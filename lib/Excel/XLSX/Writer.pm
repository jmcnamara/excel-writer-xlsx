=head1 NAME

Excel::XLSX::Writer - Create a new file in the Excel 2007+ XLSX format.

=head1 VERSION

This document refers to version 0.01 of Excel::XLSX::Writer, released September XX, 2010.




=head1 SYNOPSIS

To write a string, a formatted string, a number and a formula to the first worksheet in an Excel XML spreadsheet called perl.xls:

    use Excel::XLSX::Writer;

    # Create a new Excel workbook
    my $workbook = Excel::XLSX::Writer->new("perl.xls");

    # Add a worksheet
    $worksheet = $workbook->add_worksheet();

    #  Add and define a format
    $format = $workbook->add_format(); # Add a format
    $format->set_bold();
    $format->set_color('red');
    $format->set_align('center');

    # Write a formatted and unformatted string, row and column notation.
    $col = $row = 0;
    $worksheet->write($row, $col, "Hi Excel!", $format);
    $worksheet->write(1,    $col, "Hi Excel!");

    # Write a number and a formula using A1 notation
    $worksheet->write('A3', 1.2345);
    $worksheet->write('A4', '=SIN(PI()/4)');




=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Excel::XLSX::Writer> module can be used to create an Excel file in the 2007+ XLSX format.

Multiple worksheets can be added to a workbook and formatting can be applied to cells. Text, numbers, and formulas can be written to the cells.


C<Excel::XLSX::Writer> uses the same interface as C<Spreadsheet::WriteExcel>.

This module cannot, as yet, be used to write to an existing Excel XLSX file.




=head1 Excel::XLSX::Writer and Spreadsheet::WriteExcel

C<Excel::XLSX::Writer> uses the same interface as the C<Spreadsheet::WriteExcel> module which produces an Excel file in binary format.

While Excel::XLSX::Writer doesn't currently support all of the features of Spreadsheet::WriteExcel the intention is that it eventually will.


=head1 QUICK START

Excel::XLSX::Writer tries to provide an interface to as many of Excel's features as possible. As a result there is a lot of documentation to accompany the interface and it can be difficult at first glance to see what it important and what is not. So for those of you who prefer to assemble Ikea furniture first and then read the instructions, here are three easy steps:

1. Create a new Excel I<workbook> (i.e. file) using C<new()>.

2. Add a I<worksheet> to the new workbook using C<add_worksheet()>.

3. Write to the worksheet using C<write()>.

Like this:

    use Excel::XLSX::Writer;                             # Step 0

    my $workbook = Excel::XLSX::Writer->new("perl.xls"); # Step 1
    $worksheet   = $workbook->add_worksheet();                  # Step 2
    $worksheet->write('A1', "Hi Excel!");                       # Step 3

This will create an Excel file called C<perl.xls> with a single worksheet and the text C<"Hi Excel!"> in the relevant cell. And that's it. Okay, so there is actually a zeroth step as well, but C<use module> goes without saying. There are also more than 40 examples that come with the distribution and which you can use to get you started. See L<EXAMPLES>.

Those of you who read the instructions first and assemble the furniture afterwards will know how to proceed. ;-)




=head1 WORKBOOK METHODS

The Excel::XLSX::Writer module provides an object oriented interface to a new Excel workbook. The following methods are available through a new workbook.

    new()
    close()
    set_tempdir() **
    add_worksheet()
    add_format()
    set_custom_color() *
    sheets()
    set_1904() *
    set_codepage() *
    use_lower_cell_limits()

    *   Not yet supported. See Spreadsheet::WriteExcel.
    **  Not required by Excel::XLSX::Writer.

If you are unfamiliar with object oriented interfaces or the way that they are implemented in Perl have a look at C<perlobj> and C<perltoot> in the main Perl documentation.




=head2 new()

A new Excel workbook is created using the C<new()> constructor which accepts either a filename or a filehandle as a parameter. The following example creates a new Excel file based on a filename:

    my $workbook  = Excel::XLSX::Writer->new('filename.xls');
    my $worksheet = $workbook->add_worksheet();
    $worksheet->write(0, 0, 'Hi Excel!');

Here are some other examples of using C<new()> with filenames:

    my $workbook1 = Excel::XLSX::Writer->new($filename);
    my $workbook2 = Excel::XLSX::Writer->new('/tmp/filename.xls');
    my $workbook3 = Excel::XLSX::Writer->new("c:\\tmp\\filename.xls");
    my $workbook4 = Excel::XLSX::Writer->new('c:\tmp\filename.xls');

The last two examples demonstrates how to create a file on DOS or Windows where it is necessary to either escape the directory separator C<\> or to use single quotes to ensure that it isn't interpolated. For more information see C<perlfaq5: Why can't I use "C:\temp\foo" in DOS paths?>.

The C<new()> constructor returns a Excel::XLSX::Writer object that you can use to add worksheets and store data. It should be noted that although C<my> is not specifically required it defines the scope of the new workbook variable and, in the majority of cases, ensures that the workbook is closed properly without explicitly calling the C<close()> method.

If the file cannot be created, due to file permissions or some other reason,  C<new> will return C<undef>. Therefore, it is good practice to check the return value of C<new> before proceeding. As usual the Perl variable C<$!> will be set if there is a file creation error. You will also see one of the warning messages detailed in L<DIAGNOSTICS>:

    my $workbook  = Excel::XLSX::Writer->new('protected.xls');
    die "Problems creating new Excel file: $!" unless defined $workbook;

You can also pass a valid filehandle to the C<new()> constructor. For example in a CGI program you could do something like this:

    my $workbook  = Excel::XLSX::Writer->new(\*STDOUT);

For CGI programs you can also use the special Perl filename C<'-'> which will redirect the output to STDOUT:

    my $workbook  = Excel::XLSX::Writer->new('-');

See also, the C<cgi.pl> program in the C<examples> directory of the distro.

However, this special case will not work in C<mod_perl> programs where you will have to do something like the following:

    # mod_perl 1
    ...
    tie *XLS, 'Apache';

    my $workbook  = Excel::XLSX::Writer->new(\*XLS);
    ...

    # mod_perl 2
    ...
    tie *XLS => $r;  # Tie to the Apache::RequestRec object

    my $workbook  = Excel::XLSX::Writer->new(\*XLS);
    ...

See also, the C<mod_perl1.pl> and C<mod_perl2.pl> programs in the C<examples> directory of the distro.

Filehandles can also be useful if you want to stream an Excel file over a socket or if you want to store an Excel file in a scalar.

For example here is a way to write an Excel file to a scalar with C<perl 5.8>:

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

    use strict;
    use Spreadsheet::WriteExcel;

    # Requires perl 5.8 or later
    open my $fh, '>', \my $str or die "Failed to open filehandle: $!";

    my $workbook  = Spreadsheet::WriteExcel->new($fh);
    my $worksheet = $workbook->add_worksheet();

    $worksheet->write(0, 0,  'Hi Excel!');

    $workbook->close();

    # The Excel file in now in $str.
    print $str;

See also the C<write_to_scalar.pl> and C<filehandle.pl> programs in the C<examples> directory of the distro.




=head2 close()

In general your Excel file will be closed automatically when your program ends or when the Workbook object goes out of scope, however the C<close()> method can be used to explicitly close an Excel file.

    $workbook->close();

An explicit C<close()> is required if the file must be closed prior to performing some external action on it such as copying it, reading its size or attaching it to an email.

In addition, C<close()> may be required to prevent perl's garbage collector from disposing of the Workbook, Worksheet and Format objects in the wrong order. Situations where this can occur are:

=over 4

=item *

If C<my()> was not used to declare the scope of a workbook variable created using C<new()>.

=item *

If the C<new()>, C<add_worksheet()> or C<add_format()> methods are called in subroutines.

=back

The reason for this is that Excel::XLSX::Writer relies on Perl's C<DESTROY> mechanism to trigger destructor methods in a specific sequence. This may not happen in cases where the Workbook, Worksheet and Format variables are not lexically scoped or where they have different lexical scopes.

In general, if you create a file with a size of 0 bytes or you fail to create a file you need to call C<close()>.

The return value of C<close()> is the same as that returned by perl when it closes the file created by C<new()>. This allows you to handle error conditions in the usual way:

    $workbook->close() or die "Error closing file: $!";




=head2 set_tempdir()

This method isn't used by Excel::XLSX::Writer. It is only required by Spreadsheet::WriteExcel.




=head2 add_worksheet($sheetname)

At least one worksheet should be added to a new workbook. A worksheet is used to write data into cells:

    $worksheet1 = $workbook->add_worksheet();          # Sheet1
    $worksheet2 = $workbook->add_worksheet('Foglio2'); # Foglio2
    $worksheet3 = $workbook->add_worksheet('Data');    # Data
    $worksheet4 = $workbook->add_worksheet();          # Sheet4

If C<$sheetname> is not specified the default Excel convention will be followed, i.e. Sheet1, Sheet2, etc.

The worksheet name must be a valid Excel worksheet name, i.e. it cannot contain any of the following characters, C<: * ? / \> and it must be less than 32 characters. In addition, you cannot use the same, case insensitive, C<$sheetname> for more than one worksheet.




=head2 add_format(%properties)

The C<add_format()> method can be used to create new Format objects which are used to apply formatting to a cell. You can either define the properties at creation time via a hash of property values or later via method calls.

    $format1 = $workbook->add_format(%props); # Set properties at creation
    $format2 = $workbook->add_format();       # Set properties later

See the L<CELL FORMATTING> section for more details about Format properties and how to set them.




=head2 set_custom_color($index, $red, $green, $blue)

B<Note:> This method is not yet supported by Excel::XLSX::Writer. See Spreadsheet::WriteExcel if you need this feature.

The C<set_custom_color()> method can be used to override one of the built-in palette values with a more suitable colour.

The value for C<$index> should be in the range 8..63, see L<COLOURS IN EXCEL>.

The default named colours use the following indices:

     8   =>   black
     9   =>   white
    10   =>   red
    11   =>   lime
    12   =>   blue
    13   =>   yellow
    14   =>   magenta
    15   =>   cyan
    16   =>   brown
    17   =>   green
    18   =>   navy
    20   =>   purple
    22   =>   silver
    23   =>   gray
    53   =>   orange

A new colour is set using its RGB (red green blue) components. The C<$red>, C<$green> and C<$blue> values must be in the range 0..255. You can determine the required values in Excel using the C<Tools-E<gt>Options-E<gt>Colors-E<gt>Modify> dialog.

The C<set_custom_color()> workbook method can also be used with a HTML style C<#rrggbb> hex value:

    $workbook->set_custom_color(40, 255,  102,  0   ); # Orange
    $workbook->set_custom_color(40, 0xFF, 0x66, 0x00); # Same thing
    $workbook->set_custom_color(40, '#FF6600'       ); # Same thing

    my $font = $workbook->add_format(color => 40); # Use the modified colour

The return value from C<set_custom_color()> is the index of the colour that was changed:

    my $ferrari = $workbook->set_custom_color(40, 216, 12, 12);

    my $format  = $workbook->add_format(
                                        bg_color => $ferrari,
                                        pattern  => 1,
                                        border   => 1
                                      );




=head2 sheets(0, 1, ...)

The C<sheets()> method returns a list, or a sliced list, of the worksheets in a workbook.

If no arguments are passed the method returns a list of all the worksheets in the workbook. This is useful if you want to repeat an operation on each worksheet:

    foreach $worksheet ($workbook->sheets()) {
       print $worksheet->get_name();
    }


You can also specify a slice list to return one or more worksheet objects:

    $worksheet = $workbook->sheets(0);
    $worksheet->write('A1', 'Hello');


Or since return value from C<sheets()> is a reference to a worksheet object you can write the above example as:

    $workbook->sheets(0)->write('A1', 'Hello');


The following example returns the first and last worksheet in a workbook:

    foreach $worksheet ($workbook->sheets(0, -1)) {
       # Do something
    }


Array slices are explained in the perldata manpage.




=head2 set_1904()

B<Note:> This method is not yet supported by Excel::XLSX::Writer. See Spreadsheet::WriteExcel if you need this feature.

Excel stores dates as real numbers where the integer part stores the number of days since the epoch and the fractional part stores the percentage of the day. The epoch can be either 1900 or 1904. Excel for Windows uses 1900 and Excel for Macintosh uses 1904. However, Excel on either platform will convert automatically between one system and the other.

Excel::XLSX::Writer stores dates in the 1900 format by default. If you wish to change this you can call the C<set_1904()> workbook method. You can query the current value by calling the C<get_1904()> workbook method. This returns 0 for 1900 and 1 for 1904.

See also L<DATES IN EXCEL> for more information about working with Excel's date system.

In general you probably won't need to use C<set_1904()>.




=head2 set_codepage($codepage)

B<Note:> This method is not yet supported by Excel::XLSX::Writer. See Spreadsheet::WriteExcel if you need this feature.

The default code page or character set used by Excel::XLSX::Writer is ANSI. This is also the default used by Excel for Windows. Occasionally however it may be necessary to change the code page via the C<set_codepage()> method.

Changing the code page may be required if your are using Excel::XLSX::Writer on the Macintosh and you are using characters outside the ASCII 128 character set:

    $workbook->set_codepage(1); # ANSI, MS Windows
    $workbook->set_codepage(2); # Apple Macintosh

The C<set_codepage()> method is rarely required.




=head2 use_lower_cell_limits()

Excel 2007 allows cell limits of 1,048,576 rows x 16,384 columns. These limits are supported by Excel::XLSX::Writer for versions >= 0.11.

For backwards compatibility the older limits of 65,536 rows x 256 columns can still be imposed via the C<use_lower_cell_limits()> method.

    $workbook->use_lower_cell_limits();




=head1 WORKSHEET METHODS

A new worksheet is created by calling the C<add_worksheet()> method from a workbook object:

    $worksheet1 = $workbook->add_worksheet();
    $worksheet2 = $workbook->add_worksheet();

The following methods are available through a new worksheet:

    write()
    write_number()
    write_string()
    keep_leading_zeros()
    write_blank()
    write_html_string()
    write_row()
    write_col()
    write_date_time()
    write_url()
    write_url_range() *
    write_formula()
    store_formula() **
    repeat_formula() **
    insert_bitmap() ***
    add_write_handler()
    get_name()
    activate() *
    select() *
    set_first_sheet() *
    protect() *
    set_selection() *
    set_row()
    set_column()
    outline_settings() ***
    freeze_panes() *
    thaw_panes() *
    merge_range()
    set_zoom() *
    autofilter()
    filter_column()

    *   Not yet supported. See Spreadsheet::WriteExcel.
    **  Not required by Excel::XLSX::Writer.
    *** Not supported by Excel XML.




=head2 Cell notation

Excel::XLSX::Writer supports two forms of notation to designate the position of cells: Row-column notation and A1 notation.

Row-column notation uses a zero based index for both row and column while A1 notation uses the standard Excel alphanumeric sequence of column letter and 1-based row. For example:

    (0, 0)      # The top left cell in row-column notation.
    ('A1')      # The top left cell in A1 notation.

    (1999, 29)  # Row-column notation.
    ('AD2000')  # The same cell in A1 notation.

Row-column notation is useful if you are referring to cells programmatically:

    for my $i (0 .. 9) {
        $worksheet->write($i, 0, 'Hello'); # Cells A1 to A10
    }

A1 notation is useful for setting up a worksheet manually and for working with formulas:

    $worksheet->write('H1', 200);
    $worksheet->write('H2', '=H1+1');

In formulas and applicable methods you can also use the C<A:A> column notation:

    $worksheet->write('A1', '=SUM(B:B)');

The C<Excel::XLSX::Writer::Utility> module that is included in the distro contains helper functions for dealing with A1 notation, for example:

    use Excel::XLSX::Writer::Utility;

    ($row, $col)    = xl_cell_to_rowcol('C2');  # (1, 2)
    $str            = xl_rowcol_to_cell(1, 2);  # C2

For simplicity, the parameter lists for the worksheet method calls in the following sections are given in terms of row-column notation. In all cases it is also possible to use A1 notation.

Note: in Excel it is also possible to use a R1C1 notation. This is not supported by Excel::XLSX::Writer.




=head2 write($row, $column, $token, $format)

Excel makes a distinction between data types such as strings, numbers, blanks, formulas and hyperlinks. To simplify the process of writing data the C<write()> method acts as a general alias for several more specific methods:

    write_string()
    write_number()
    write_blank()
    write_formula()
    write_url()
    write_row()
    write_col()

The general rule is that if the data looks like a I<something> then a I<something> is written. Here are some examples in both row-column and A1 notation:

                                                      # Same as:
    $worksheet->write(0, 0, 'Hello'                ); # write_string()
    $worksheet->write(1, 0, 'One'                  ); # write_string()
    $worksheet->write(2, 0,  2                     ); # write_number()
    $worksheet->write(3, 0,  3.00001               ); # write_number()
    $worksheet->write(4, 0,  ""                    ); # write_blank()
    $worksheet->write(5, 0,  ''                    ); # write_blank()
    $worksheet->write(6, 0,  undef                 ); # write_blank()
    $worksheet->write(7, 0                         ); # write_blank()
    $worksheet->write(8, 0,  'http://www.perl.com/'); # write_url()
    $worksheet->write('A9',  'ftp://ftp.cpan.org/' ); # write_url()
    $worksheet->write('A10', 'internal:Sheet1!A1'  ); # write_url()
    $worksheet->write('A11', 'external:c:\foo.xls' ); # write_url()
    $worksheet->write('A12', '=A3 + 3*A4'          ); # write_formula()
    $worksheet->write('A13', '=SIN(PI()/4)'        ); # write_formula()
    $worksheet->write('A14', \@array               ); # write_row()
    $worksheet->write('A15', [\@array]             ); # write_col()

    # And if the keep_leading_zeros property is set:
    $worksheet->write('A16,  2                     ); # write_number()
    $worksheet->write('A17,  02                    ); # write_string()
    $worksheet->write('A18,  00002                 ); # write_string()

    # Write an array formula. Not available in Spreadsheet::WriteExcel.
    $worksheet->write('A18,  '{=SUM(A1:B1*A2:B2)}' ); # write_formula()


The "looks like" rule is defined by regular expressions:

C<write_number()> if C<$token> is a number based on the following regex: C<$token =~ /^([+-]?)(?=\d|\.\d)\d*(\.\d*)?([Ee]([+-]?\d+))?$/>.

C<write_string()> if C<keep_leading_zeros()> is set and C<$token> is an integer with leading zeros based on the following regex: C<$token =~ /^0\d+$/>.

C<write_blank()> if C<$token> is undef or a blank string: C<undef>, C<""> or C<''>.

C<write_url()> if C<$token> is a http, https, ftp or mailto URL based on the following regexes: C<$token =~ m|^[fh]tt?ps?://|> or  C<$token =~ m|^mailto:|>.

C<write_url()> if C<$token> is an internal or external sheet reference based on the following regex: C<$token =~ m[^(in|ex)ternal:]>.

C<write_formula()> if the first character of C<$token> is C<"=">.

C<write_array_formula()> if the C<$token> matches C</^{=.*}$/>.

C<write_row()> if C<$token> is an array ref.

C<write_col()> if C<$token> is an array ref of array refs.

C<write_string()> if none of the previous conditions apply.

The C<$format> parameter is optional. It should be a valid Format object, see L<CELL FORMATTING>:

    my $format = $workbook->add_format();
    $format->set_bold();
    $format->set_color('red');
    $format->set_align('center');

    $worksheet->write(4, 0, 'Hello', $format); # Formatted string

The write() method will ignore empty strings or C<undef> tokens unless a format is also supplied. As such you needn't worry about special handling for empty or C<undef> values in your data. See also the C<write_blank()> method.

One problem with the C<write()> method is that occasionally data looks like a number but you don't want it treated as a number. For example, zip codes or ID numbers often start with a leading zero. If you write this data as a number then the leading zero(s) will be stripped. You can change this default behaviour by using the C<keep_leading_zeros()> method. While this property is in place any integers with leading zeros will be treated as strings and the zeros will be preserved. See the C<keep_leading_zeros()> section for a full discussion of this issue.

You can also add your own data handlers to the C<write()> method using C<add_write_handler()>.

On systems with C<perl 5.8> and later the C<write()> method will also handle Unicode strings in C<UTF-8> format.

The C<write> methods return:

    0 for success.
   -1 for insufficient number of arguments.
   -2 for row or column out of bounds.
   -3 for string too long.




=head2 write_number($row, $column, $number, $format)

Write an integer or a float to the cell specified by C<$row> and C<$column>:

    $worksheet->write_number(0, 0,  123456);
    $worksheet->write_number('A2',  2.3451);

See the note about L<Cell notation>. The C<$format> parameter is optional.

In general it is sufficient to use the C<write()> method.




=head2 write_string($row, $column, $string, $format)

Write a string to the cell specified by C<$row> and C<$column>:

    $worksheet->write_string(0, 0, 'Your text here' );
    $worksheet->write_string('A2', 'or here' );

The maximum string size is 32767 characters. However the maximum string segment that Excel can display in a cell is 1000. All 32767 characters can be displayed in the formula bar.

The C<$format> parameter is optional.

On systems with C<perl 5.8> and later the C<write()> method will also handle strings in Perl's C<utf8> format. See also the C<unicode_*.pl> programs in the examples directory of the distro.

In general it is sufficient to use the C<write()> method. However, you may sometimes wish to use the C<write_string()> method to write data that looks like a number but that you don't want treated as a number. For example, zip codes or phone numbers:

    # Write as a plain string
    $worksheet->write_string('A1', '01209');

However, if the user edits this string Excel may convert it back to a number. To get around this you can use the Excel text format C<@>:

    # Format as a string. Doesn't change to a number when edited
    my $format1 = $workbook->add_format(num_format => '@');
    $worksheet->write_string('A2', '01209', $format1);

See also the note about L<Cell notation>.




=head2 keep_leading_zeros()

This method changes the default handling of integers with leading zeros when using the C<write()> method.

The C<write()> method uses regular expressions to determine what type of data to write to an Excel worksheet. If the data looks like a number it writes a number using C<write_number()>. One problem with this approach is that occasionally data looks like a number but you don't want it treated as a number.

Zip codes and ID numbers, for example, often start with a leading zero. If you write this data as a number then the leading zero(s) will be stripped. This is the also the default behaviour when you enter data manually in Excel.

To get around this you can use one of three options. Write a formatted number, write the number as a string or use the C<keep_leading_zeros()> method to change the default behaviour of C<write()>:

    # Implicitly write a number, the leading zero is removed: 1209
    $worksheet->write('A1', '01209');

    # Write a zero padded number using a format: 01209
    my $format1 = $workbook->add_format(num_format => '00000');
    $worksheet->write('A2', '01209', $format1);

    # Write explicitly as a string: 01209
    $worksheet->write_string('A3', '01209');

    # Write implicitly as a string: 01209
    $worksheet->keep_leading_zeros();
    $worksheet->write('A4', '01209');


The above code would generate a worksheet that looked like the following:

     -----------------------------------------------------------
    |   |     A     |     B     |     C     |     D     | ...
     -----------------------------------------------------------
    | 1 |      1209 |           |           |           | ...
    | 2 |     01209 |           |           |           | ...
    | 3 | 01209     |           |           |           | ...
    | 4 | 01209     |           |           |           | ...


The examples are on different sides of the cells due to the fact that Excel displays strings with a left justification and numbers with a right justification by default. You can change this by using a format to justify the data, see L<CELL FORMATTING>.

It should be noted that if the user edits the data in examples C<A3> and C<A4> the strings will revert back to numbers. Again this is Excel's default behaviour. To avoid this you can use the text format C<@>:

    # Format as a string (01209)
    my $format2 = $workbook->add_format(num_format => '@');
    $worksheet->write_string('A5', '01209', $format2);

The C<keep_leading_zeros()> property is off by default. The C<keep_leading_zeros()> method takes 0 or 1 as an argument. It defaults to 1 if an argument isn't specified:

    $worksheet->keep_leading_zeros();  # Set on
    $worksheet->keep_leading_zeros(1); # Set on
    $worksheet->keep_leading_zeros(0); # Set off

See also the C<add_write_handler()> method.


=head2 write_blank($row, $column, $format)

Write a blank cell specified by C<$row> and C<$column>:

    $worksheet->write_blank(0, 0, $format);

This method is used to add formatting to a cell which doesn't contain a string or number value.

Excel differentiates between an "Empty" cell and a "Blank" cell. An "Empty" cell is a cell which doesn't contain data whilst a "Blank" cell is a cell which doesn't contain data but does contain formatting. Excel stores "Blank" cells but ignores "Empty" cells.

As such, if you write an empty cell without formatting it is ignored:

    $worksheet->write('A1',  undef, $format); # write_blank()
    $worksheet->write('A2',  undef         ); # Ignored

This seemingly uninteresting fact means that you can write arrays of data without special treatment for undef or empty string values.

See the note about L<Cell notation>.




=head2 write_html_string($row, $column, $html_string, $format)

The C<write_html_string> method can be used to write a string with multiple formats to a cell using simple Html tags. For example to write a string like "Some B<bold> and I<italic> text":

    my $html_string = 'Some <B>bold</B> and <I>italic</I> text';

    $worksheet->write_html_string('A1', $html_string);

Standard non-font formatting, such as background and border can also added to the cell.

    my $format = $workbook->add_format(fg_color => 'yellow', border => 6);

    $worksheet->write_html_string('A2', $html_string, $format);

The following example writes a string with subscript and superscript. It also increase the font size to make it more visible.

    my $html_str = 'x<Sub><I>j</I></Sub><Sup>(n-1)</Sup>';

    my $format   = $workbook->add_format(size => 20);

    $worksheet->write_html_string('A3', $html_string, $format);

Multiple colours can be applied to the cell text using simple Html font formatting:

    # Write a multicoloured string.

    my $html_string = '<Font html:Color="#FF0000">Red</Font>'  .
                      '<Font> and </Font>'                     .
                      '<Font html:Color="#0000FF">Blue</Font>';

    $worksheet->write_html_string('A4', $_html_string);

Only a limited subset of Html is allowed by Excel. For more complex examples create a Spreadsheet XML file in Excel and examine the output.

Note: This method is not available in Spreadsheet::WriteExcel.




=head2 write_row($row, $column, $array_ref, $format)

The C<write_row()> method can be used to write a 1D or 2D array of data in one go. This is useful for converting the results of a database query into an Excel worksheet. You must pass a reference to the array of data rather than the array itself. The C<write()> method is then called for each element of the data. For example:

    @array      = ('awk', 'gawk', 'mawk');
    $array_ref  = \@array;

    $worksheet->write_row(0, 0, $array_ref);

    # The above example is equivalent to:
    $worksheet->write(0, 0, $array[0]);
    $worksheet->write(0, 1, $array[1]);
    $worksheet->write(0, 2, $array[2]);


Note: For convenience the C<write()> method behaves in the same way as C<write_row()> if it is passed an array reference. Therefore the following two method calls are equivalent:

    $worksheet->write_row('A1', $array_ref); # Write a row of data
    $worksheet->write(    'A1', $array_ref); # Same thing

As with all of the write methods the C<$format> parameter is optional. If a format is specified it is applied to all the elements of the data array.

Array references within the data will be treated as columns. This allows you to write 2D arrays of data in one go. For example:

    @eec =  (
                ['maggie', 'milly', 'molly', 'may'  ],
                [13,       14,      15,      16     ],
                ['shell',  'star',  'crab',  'stone']
            );

    $worksheet->write_row('A1', \@eec);


Would produce a worksheet as follows:

     -----------------------------------------------------------
    |   |    A    |    B    |    C    |    D    |    E    | ...
     -----------------------------------------------------------
    | 1 | maggie  | 13      | shell   | ...     |  ...    | ...
    | 2 | milly   | 14      | star    | ...     |  ...    | ...
    | 3 | molly   | 15      | crab    | ...     |  ...    | ...
    | 4 | may     | 16      | stone   | ...     |  ...    | ...
    | 5 | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     |  ...    | ...
    | 6 | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     |  ...    | ...


To write the data in a row-column order refer to the C<write_col()> method below.

Any C<undef> values in the data will be ignored unless a format is applied to the data, in which case a formatted blank cell will be written. In either case the appropriate row or column value will still be incremented.

To find out more about array references refer to C<perlref> and C<perlreftut> in the main Perl documentation. To find out more about 2D arrays or "lists of lists" refer to C<perllol>.

The C<write_row()> method returns the first error encountered when writing the elements of the data or zero if no errors were encountered. See the return values described for the C<write()> method above.

See also the C<write_arrays.pl> program in the C<examples> directory of the distro.

The C<write_row()> method allows the following idiomatic conversion of a text file to an Excel file:

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

    use strict;
    use Excel::XLSX::Writer;

    my $workbook  = Excel::XLSX::Writer->new('file.xls');
    my $worksheet = $workbook->add_worksheet();

    open INPUT, 'file.txt' or die "Couldn't open file: $!";

    $worksheet->write($.-1, 0, [split]) while <INPUT>;




=head2 write_col($row, $column, $array_ref, $format)

The C<write_col()> method can be used to write a 1D or 2D array of data in one go. This is useful for converting the results of a database query into an Excel worksheet. You must pass a reference to the array of data rather than the array itself. The C<write()> method is then called for each element of the data. For example:

    @array      = ('awk', 'gawk', 'mawk');
    $array_ref  = \@array;

    $worksheet->write_col(0, 0, $array_ref);

    # The above example is equivalent to:
    $worksheet->write(0, 0, $array[0]);
    $worksheet->write(1, 0, $array[1]);
    $worksheet->write(2, 0, $array[2]);

As with all of the write methods the C<$format> parameter is optional. If a format is specified it is applied to all the elements of the data array.

Array references within the data will be treated as rows. This allows you to write 2D arrays of data in one go. For example:

    @eec =  (
                ['maggie', 'milly', 'molly', 'may'  ],
                [13,       14,      15,      16     ],
                ['shell',  'star',  'crab',  'stone']
            );

    $worksheet->write_col('A1', \@eec);


Would produce a worksheet as follows:

     -----------------------------------------------------------
    |   |    A    |    B    |    C    |    D    |    E    | ...
     -----------------------------------------------------------
    | 1 | maggie  | milly   | molly   | may     |  ...    | ...
    | 2 | 13      | 14      | 15      | 16      |  ...    | ...
    | 3 | shell   | star    | crab    | stone   |  ...    | ...
    | 4 | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     |  ...    | ...
    | 5 | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     |  ...    | ...
    | 6 | ...     | ...     | ...     | ...     |  ...    | ...


To write the data in a column-row order refer to the C<write_row()> method above.

Any C<undef> values in the data will be ignored unless a format is applied to the data, in which case a formatted blank cell will be written. In either case the appropriate row or column value will still be incremented.

As noted above the C<write()> method can be used as a synonym for C<write_row()> and C<write_row()> handles nested array refs as columns. Therefore, the following two method calls are equivalent although the more explicit call to C<write_col()> would be preferable for maintainability:

    $worksheet->write_col('A1', $array_ref    ); # Write a column of data
    $worksheet->write(    'A1', [ $array_ref ]); # Same thing

To find out more about array references refer to C<perlref> and C<perlreftut> in the main Perl documentation. To find out more about 2D arrays or "lists of lists" refer to C<perllol>.

The C<write_col()> method returns the first error encountered when writing the elements of the data or zero if no errors were encountered. See the return values described for the C<write()> method above.

See also the C<write_arrays.pl> program in the C<examples> directory of the distro.




=head2 write_date_time($row, $col, $date_string, $format)

The C<write_date_time()> method can be used to write a date or time to the cell specified by C<$row> and C<$column>:

    $worksheet->write_date_time('A1', '2004-05-13T23:20', $date_format);

The C<$date_string> should be in the following format:

    yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sss

This conforms to an ISO8601 date but it should be noted that the full range of ISO8601 formats are not supported.

The following variations on the C<$date_string> parameter are permitted:

    yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sss         # Standard format
    yyyy-mm-ddT                     # No time
              Thh:mm:ss.sss         # No date
    yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ        # Additional Z (but not time zones)
    yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss             # No fractional seconds
    yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm                # No seconds

Note that the C<T> is required in all cases.

A date should always have a C<$format>, otherwise it will appear as a number, see L<CELL FORMATTING> and L<DATES IN EXCEL>. Here is a typical example:

    my $date_format = $workbook->add_format(num_format => 'mm/dd/yy');
    $worksheet->write_date_time('A1', '2004-05-13T23:20', $date_format);

Excel::XLSX::Writer also allows Excel's newer text description formats:

    General Date
    Short Date
    Medium Date
    Long Date
    Short Time
    Medium Time
    Long Time

    my $date_format = $workbook->add_format(num_format => 'Short Date');
    $worksheet->write_date_time('A1', '2004-05-13T23:20', $date_format);

Valid dates should be in the range 1900-01-01 to 9999-12-31, for the 1900 epoch. As with Excel, dates outside these ranges will be written as a string. The 1904 epoch is not supported in this release.

To write a time with a zero date use the date C<1899-12-31>. This is an Excel quirk. See L<DATES IN EXCEL>.

    $worksheet->write_date_time('A1', '1899-12-31T23:20', $date_format);



See also the C<date_time.pl> program in the C<examples> directory of the distro.




=head2 write_url($row, $col, $url, $format, $string, $tip)

Write a hyperlink to a URL in the cell specified by C<$row> and C<$column>. The hyperlink is comprised of two elements: the visible label and the invisible link. The visible label is the same as the link unless an alternative string is specified.

The parameters C<$format>, C<$string> and C<$tip> are optional. Note however that without a C<$format> the url will not appear with the standard blue underline. This behaviour is different from older versions of C<Spreadsheet::WriteExcel>. To achieve this effect you must add an explicit format:

    my $format = $workbook->add_format(color => 'blue', underline => 1);

You can add a I<tooltip> to the url by specifying the C<$tip> parameter. This is feature isn't supported in C<Excel::XLSX::Writer>.

There are four web style URI's supported: C<http://>, C<https://>, C<ftp://> and  C<mailto:>:

    $worksheet->write_url(0, 0, 'ftp://www.perl.org/',  $format            );
    $worksheet->write_url(1, 0, 'http://www.perl.com/', $format 'Perl home');
    $worksheet->write_url('A3', 'http://www.perl.com/', $format            );
    $worksheet->write_url('A4', 'http://www.perl.com/', 'Perl home',$format);
    $worksheet->write_url('A5', 'mailto:jmcnamara@cpan.org'                );

There are two local URIs supported: C<internal:> and C<external:>. These are used for hyperlinks to internal worksheet references or external workbook and worksheet references:

    $worksheet->write_url('A6',  'internal:Sheet2!A1',        $format);
    $worksheet->write_url('A7',  'internal:Sheet2!A1:B2',     $format);
    $worksheet->write_url('A8',  q{internal:'Sales Data'!A1}, $format);
    $worksheet->write_url('A9',  'external:c:\temp\foo.xls',  $format);
    $worksheet->write_url('A10', 'external:c:\temp\foo.xls#Sheet2!A1');
    $worksheet->write_url('A11', 'external:\\\\NETWORK\share\foo.xls');

Note that the relative style directory link such as C< ..\foo.xls> is not supported by Excel XML. You must use an absolute directory link instead.

All of the these URI types are recognised by the C<write()> method, see above.

Worksheet references are typically of the form C<Sheet1!A1>. You can also refer to a worksheet range using the standard Excel notation: C<Sheet1!A1:B2>.

In external links the workbook and worksheet name must be separated by the C<#> character: C<external:Workbook.xls#Sheet1!A1'>.

You can also link to a named range in the target worksheet. For example say you have a named range called C<my_name> in the workbook C<c:\temp\foo.xls> you could link to it as follows:

    $worksheet->write_url('A14', 'external:c:\temp\foo.xls#my_name');

Note, you cannot currently create named ranges with C<Excel::XLSX::Writer>.

Excel requires that worksheet names containing spaces or non alphanumeric characters are single quoted as follows C<'Sales Data'!A1>. If you need to do this in a single quoted string then you can either escape the single quotes C<\'> or use the quote operator C<q{}> as described in C<perlop> in the main Perl documentation.

Links to network files are also supported. MS/Novell Network files normally begin with two back slashes as follows C<\\NETWORK\etc>. In order to generate this in a single or double quoted string you will have to escape the backslashes,  C<'\\\\NETWORK\etc'>.

If you are using double quote strings then you should be careful to escape anything that looks like a metacharacter. For more information see C<perlfaq5: Why can't I use "C:\temp\foo" in DOS paths?>.

Finally, you can avoid most of these quoting problems by using forward slashes. These are translated internally to backslashes:

    $worksheet->write_url('A14', "external:c:/temp/foo.xls"             );
    $worksheet->write_url('A15', 'external://NETWORK/share/foo.xls'     );

See also, the note about L<Cell notation>.




=head2 write_url_range($row1, $col1, $row2, $col2, $url, $string, $format)

B<Note:> This method is not yet supported by Excel::XLSX::Writer. See Spreadsheet::WriteExcel if you need this feature.

This method is essentially the same as the C<write_url()> method described above. The main difference is that you can specify a link for a range of cells:

    $worksheet->write_url(0, 0, 0, 3, 'ftp://www.perl.org/'              );
    $worksheet->write_url(1, 0, 0, 3, 'http://www.perl.com/', 'Perl home');
    $worksheet->write_url('A3:D3',    'internal:Sheet2!A1'               );
    $worksheet->write_url('A4:D4',    'external:c:\temp\foo.xls'         );


This method is generally only required when used in conjunction with merged cells. See the C<merge_range()> method and the C<merge> property of a Format object, L<CELL FORMATTING>.

There is no way to force this behaviour through the C<write()> method.

The parameters C<$string> and the C<$format> are optional and their position is interchangeable. However, they are applied only to the first cell in the range.

See also, the note about L<Cell notation>.




=head2 write_formula($row, $column, $formula, $format)

Write a formula or function to the cell specified by C<$row> and C<$column>:

    $worksheet->write_formula(0, 0, '=$B$3 + B4'  );
    $worksheet->write_formula(1, 0, '=SIN(PI()/4)');
    $worksheet->write_formula(2, 0, '=SUM(B1:B5)' );
    $worksheet->write_formula('A4', '=IF(A3>1,"Yes", "No")'   );
    $worksheet->write_formula('A5', '=AVERAGE(1, 2, 3, 4)'    );
    $worksheet->write_formula('A6', '=DATEVALUE("1-Jan-2001")');

Array formulas are also supported:

    $worksheet->write_formula('A7', '{=SUM(A1:B1*A2:B2)}'     );

See also the C<write_array_formula()> method below.

Note: Array formulas are not supported by Spreadsheet::WriteExcel.

See the note about L<Cell notation>. For more information about writing Excel formulas see L<FORMULAS AND FUNCTIONS IN EXCEL>




=head2 write_array_formula($first_row, $first_col, $last_row, $last_col, $formula, $format)

Write an array formula to a cell range. In Excel an array formula is a formula that performs a calculation on a set of values. It can return a single value or a range of values.

An array formula is indicated by a pair of braces around the formula: C<{=SUM(A1:B1*A2:B2)}>.  If the array formula returns a single value then the C<$first_> and C<$last_> parameters should be the same:

    $worksheet->write_array_formula('A1:A1', '{=SUM(B1:C1*B2:C2)}');

It this case however it is easier to just use the C<write_formula()> or C<write()> methods:

    # Same as above but more concise.
    $worksheet->write('A1', '{=SUM(B1:C1*B2:C2)}');
    $worksheet->write_formula('A1', '{=SUM(B1:C1*B2:C2)}');

For array formulas that return a range of values you must specify the range that the return values will be written to:

    $worksheet->write_array_formula('A1:A3',    '{=TREND(C1:C3,B1:B3)}');
    $worksheet->write_array_formula(0, 0, 2, 0, '{=TREND(C1:C3,B1:B3)}');

Note: Array formulas are not supported by Spreadsheet::WriteExcel.




=head2 store_formula($formula)

This method isn't used by Excel::XLSX::Writer. It is only required by Spreadsheet::WriteExcel.



=head2 repeat_formula($row, $col, $formula, $format, ($pattern => $replace, ...))

This method isn't used by Excel::XLSX::Writer. It is only required by Spreadsheet::WriteExcel.





=head2 write_comment($row, $column, $string)

B<Note:> This method is not yet supported by Excel::XLSX::Writer. See Spreadsheet::WriteExcel if you need this feature.

The C<write_comment()> method is used to add a comment to a cell. A cell comment is indicated in Excel by a small red triangle in the upper right-hand corner of the cell. Moving the cursor over the red triangle will cause the comment to appear.

The following example shows how to add a comment to a cell:

    $worksheet->write("C3", "Hello");
    $worksheet->write_comment("C3", "This is a comment.");


The cell comment can be up to 30,000 characters in length.

No formatting of the text or the text box is possible with the Excel 5 version of this method.

Note: the C<write_comment()> method was previously supplied as an external example program. If you are currently using that method you will get a warning about subroutines being redefined:

    Subroutine write_comment redefined at ... line ...
    Subroutine _store_comment  redefined at ... line ...

You can safely delete the user defined C<write_comment()> code from your old programs and use the module defined method instead.




=head2 add_write_handler($re, $code_ref)

This method is used to extend the Excel::XLSX::Writer write() method to handle user defined data.

If you refer to the section on C<write()> above you will see that it acts as an alias for several more specific C<write_*> methods. However, it doesn't always act in exactly the way that you would like it to.

One solution is to filter the input data yourself and call the appropriate C<write_*> method. Another approach is to use the C<add_write_handler()> method to add your own automated behaviour to C<write()>.

The C<add_write_handler()> method take two arguments, C<$re>, a regular expression to match incoming data and C<$code_ref> a callback function to handle the matched data:

    $worksheet->add_write_handler(qr/^\d\d\d\d$/, \&my_write);

(In the these examples the C<qr> operator is used to quote the regular expression strings, see L<perlop> for more details).

The method is used as follows. say you wished to write 7 digit ID numbers as a string so that any leading zeros were preserved*, you could do something like the following:

    $worksheet->add_write_handler(qr/^\d{7}$/, \&write_my_id);


    sub write_my_id {
        my $worksheet = shift;
        return $worksheet->write_string(@_);
    }

* You could also use the C<keep_leading_zeros()> method for this.

Then if you call C<write()> with an appropriate string it will be handled automatically:

    # Writes 0000000. It would normally be written as a number; 0.
    $worksheet->write('A1', '0000000');

The callback function will receive a reference to the calling worksheet and all of the other arguments that were passed to C<write()>. The callback will see an C<@_> argument list that looks like the following:

    $_[0]   A ref to the calling worksheet. *
    $_[1]   Zero based row number.
    $_[2]   Zero based column number.
    $_[3]   A number or string or token.
    $_[4]   A format ref if any.
    $_[5]   Any other arguments.
    ...

    *  It is good style to shift this off the list so the @_ is the same
       as the argument list seen by write().

Your callback should C<return()> the return value of the C<write_*> method that was called or C<undef> to indicate that you rejected the match and want C<write()> to continue as normal.

So for example if you wished to apply the previous filter only to ID values that occur in the first column you could modify your callback function as follows:


    sub write_my_id {
        my $worksheet = shift;
        my $col       = $_[1];

        if ($col == 0) {
            return $worksheet->write_string(@_);
        }
        else {
            # Reject the match and return control to write()
            return undef;
        }
    }

Now, you will get different behaviour for the first column and other columns:

    $worksheet->write('A1', '0000000'); # Writes 0000000
    $worksheet->write('B1', '0000000'); # Writes 0


You may add more than one handler in which case they will be called in the order that they were added.

Note, the C<add_write_handler()> method is particularly suited for handling dates.

See the C<write_handler 1-4> programs in the C<examples> directory for further examples.




=head2 insert_bitmap($row, $col, $filename, $x, $y, $scale_x, $scale_y)

Embedded images are not supported by Excel XML. See Spreadsheet::WriteExcel if you need this feature.



=head2 get_name()

The C<get_name()> method is used to retrieve the name of a worksheet. For example:

    foreach my $sheet ($workbook->sheets()) {
        print $sheet->get_name();
    }




=head2 activate()

B<Note:> This method is not yet supported by Excel::XLSX::Writer. See Spreadsheet::WriteExcel if you need this feature.

The C<activate()> method is used to specify which worksheet is initially visible in a multi-sheet workbook:

    $worksheet1 = $workbook->add_worksheet('To');
    $worksheet2 = $workbook->add_worksheet('the');
    $worksheet3 = $workbook->add_worksheet('wind');

    $worksheet3->activate();

This is similar to the Excel VBA activate method. More than one worksheet can be selected via the C<select()> method, however only one worksheet can be active. The default value is the first worksheet.




=head2 select()

B<Note:> This method is not yet supported by Excel::XLSX::Writer. See Spreadsheet::WriteExcel if you need this feature.

The C<select()> method is used to indicate that a worksheet is selected in a multi-sheet workbook:

    $worksheet1->activate();
    $worksheet2->select();
    $worksheet3->select();

A selected worksheet has its tab highlighted. Selecting worksheets is a way of grouping them together so that, for example, several worksheets could be printed in one go. A worksheet that has been activated via the C<activate()> method will also appear as selected. You probably won't need to use the C<select()> method very often.




=head2 set_first_sheet()

B<Note:> This method is not yet supported by Excel::XLSX::Writer. See Spreadsheet::WriteExcel if you need this feature.

The C<activate()> method determines which worksheet is initially selected. However, if there are a large number of worksheets the selected worksheet may not appear on the screen. To avoid this you can select which is the leftmost visible worksheet using C<set_first_sheet()>:

    for (1..20) {
        $workbook->add_worksheet;
    }

    $worksheet21 = $workbook->add_worksheet();
    $worksheet22 = $workbook->add_worksheet();

    $worksheet21->set_first_sheet();
    $worksheet22->activate();

This method is not required very often. The default value is the first worksheet.




=head2 protect($password)

The C<protect()> method is used to protect a worksheet from modification:

    $worksheet->protect();

It can be turned off in Excel via the C<Tools-E<gt>Protection-E<gt>Unprotect Sheet> menu command.

The C<protect()> method also has the effect of enabling a cell's C<locked> and C<hidden> properties if they have been set. A "locked" cell cannot be edited. A "hidden" cell will display the results of a formula but not the formula itself. In Excel a cell's locked property is on by default.

    # Set some format properties
    my $unlocked  = $workbook->add_format(locked => 0);
    my $hidden    = $workbook->add_format(hidden => 1);

    # Enable worksheet protection
    $worksheet->protect();

    # This cell cannot be edited, it is locked by default
    $worksheet->write('A1', '=1+2');

    # This cell can be edited
    $worksheet->write('A2', '=1+2', $unlocked);

    # The formula in this cell isn't visible
    $worksheet->write('A3', '=1+2', $hidden);

See also the C<set_locked> and C<set_hidden> format methods in L<CELL FORMATTING>.

You can optionally add a password to the worksheet protection:

    $worksheet->protect('drowssap');

Note, the worksheet level password in Excel provides very weak protection. It does not encrypt your data in any way and it is very easy to deactivate. Therefore, do not use the above method if you wish to protect sensitive data or calculations. However, before you get worried, Excel's own workbook level password protection does provide strong encryption in Excel 97+. For technical reasons this will never be supported by C<Excel::XLSX::Writer>.




=head2 set_selection($first_row, $first_col, $last_row, $last_col)

B<Note:> This method is not yet supported by Excel::XLSX::Writer. See Spreadsheet::WriteExcel if you need this feature.

This method can be used to specify which cell or cells are selected in a worksheet. The most common requirement is to select a single cell, in which case C<$last_row> and C<$last_col> can be omitted. The active cell within a selected range is determined by the order in which C<$first> and C<$last> are specified. It is also possible to specify a cell or a range using A1 notation. See the note about L<Cell notation>.

Examples:

    $worksheet1->set_selection(3, 3);       # 1. Cell D4.
    $worksheet2->set_selection(3, 3, 6, 6); # 2. Cells D4 to G7.
    $worksheet3->set_selection(6, 6, 3, 3); # 3. Cells G7 to D4.
    $worksheet4->set_selection('D4');       # Same as 1.
    $worksheet5->set_selection('D4:G7');    # Same as 2.
    $worksheet6->set_selection('G7:D4');    # Same as 3.

The default cell selections is (0, 0), 'A1'.




=head2 set_row($row, $height, $format, $hidden)

This method can be used to change the default properties of a row. All parameters apart from C<$row> are optional.

The most common use for this method is to change the height of a row:

    $worksheet->set_row(0, 20); # Row 1 height set to 20

If you wish to set the format without changing the height you can pass C<undef> as the height parameter:

    $worksheet->set_row(0, undef, $format);

The C<$format> parameter will be applied to any cells in the row that don't have a format. For example

    $worksheet->set_row(0, undef, $format1);    # Set the format for row 1
    $worksheet->write('A1', 'Hello');           # Defaults to $format1
    $worksheet->write('B1', 'Hello', $format2); # Keeps $format2

If you wish to define a row format in this way you should call the method before any calls to C<write()>. Calling it afterwards will overwrite any format that was previously specified.

The C<$hidden> parameter should be set to 1 if you wish to hide a row. This can be used, for example, to hide intermediary steps in a complicated calculation:

    $worksheet->set_row(0, 20,    $format, 1);
    $worksheet->set_row(1, undef, undef,   1);

B<Note:> Spreadsheet::WriteExcel supports another parameter in relation to L<OUTLINES AND GROUPING IN EXCEL>. This feature is not supported by Excel XML.




=head2 set_column($first_col, $last_col, $width, $format, $hidden)

This method can be used to change the default properties of a single column or a range of columns. All parameters apart from C<$first_col> and C<$last_col> are optional.

If C<set_column()> is applied to a single column the value of C<$first_col> and C<$last_col> should be the same. In the case where C<$last_col> is zero it is set to the same value as C<$first_col>.

It is also possible, and generally clearer, to specify a column range using the form of A1 notation used for columns. See the note about L<Cell notation>.

Examples:

    $worksheet->set_column(0, 0,  20); # Column  A   width set to 20
    $worksheet->set_column(1, 3,  30); # Columns B-D width set to 30
    $worksheet->set_column('E:E', 20); # Column  E   width set to 20
    $worksheet->set_column('F:H', 30); # Columns F-H width set to 30

The width corresponds to the column width value that is specified in Excel. It is approximately equal to the length of a string in the default font of Arial 10. It is possible to set "AutoFit" for a column in the ExcelXML file format, but it only applies to numbers and dates and not to strings.

As usual the C<$format> parameter is optional, for additional information, see L<CELL FORMATTING>. If you wish to set the format without changing the width you can pass C<undef> as the width parameter:

    $worksheet->set_column(0, 0, undef, $format);

The C<$format> parameter will be applied to any cells in the column that don't have a format. For example

    $worksheet->set_column('A:A', undef, $format1); # Set format for col 1
    $worksheet->write('A1', 'Hello');               # Defaults to $format1
    $worksheet->write('A2', 'Hello', $format2);     # Keeps $format2

If you wish to define a column format in this way you should call the method before any calls to C<write()>. If you call it afterwards it won't have any effect.

A default row format takes precedence over a default column format

    $worksheet->set_row(0, undef,        $format1); # Set format for row 1
    $worksheet->set_column('A:A', undef, $format2); # Set format for col 1
    $worksheet->write('A1', 'Hello');               # Defaults to $format1
    $worksheet->write('A2', 'Hello');               # Defaults to $format2

The C<$hidden> parameter should be set to 1 if you wish to hide a column. This can be used, for example, to hide intermediary steps in a complicated calculation:

    $worksheet->set_column('D:D', 20,    $format, 1);
    $worksheet->set_column('E:E', undef, undef,   1);

B<Note:> Spreadsheet::WriteExcel supports another parameter in relation to L<OUTLINES AND GROUPING IN EXCEL>. This feature is not supported by Excel XML.




=head2 outline_settings($visible, $symbols_below, $symbols_right, $auto_style)

B<Note:> Outlines and Grouping is not supported by Excel XML. See Spreadsheet::WriteExcel if you need this feature.

The C<outline_settings()> method is used to control the appearance of outlines in Excel. Outlines are described in L<OUTLINES AND GROUPING IN EXCEL>.

The C<$visible> parameter is used to control whether or not outlines are visible. Setting this parameter to 0 will cause all outlines on the worksheet to be hidden. They can be unhidden in Excel by means of the "Show Outline Symbols" command button. The default setting is 1 for visible outlines.

    $worksheet->outline_settings(0);

The C<$symbols_below> parameter is used to control whether the row outline symbol will appear above or below the outline level bar. The default setting is 1 for symbols to appear below the outline level bar.

The C<symbols_right> parameter is used to control whether the column outline symbol will appear to the left or the right of the outline level bar. The default setting is 1 for symbols to appear to the right of the outline level bar.

The C<$auto_style> parameter is used to control whether the automatic outline generator in Excel uses automatic styles when creating an outline. This has no effect on a file generated by C<Excel::XLSX::Writer> but it does have an effect on how the worksheet behaves after it is created. The default setting is 0 for "Automatic Styles" to be turned off.

The default settings for all of these parameters correspond to Excel's default parameters.


The worksheet parameters controlled by C<outline_settings()> are rarely used.




=head2 freeze_panes($row, $col, $top_row, $left_col)

B<Note:> This method is not yet supported by Excel::XLSX::Writer. See Spreadsheet::WriteExcel if you need this feature.

This method can be used to divide a worksheet into horizontal or vertical regions known as panes and to also "freeze" these panes so that the splitter bars are not visible. This is the same as the C<Window-E<gt>Freeze Panes> menu command in Excel

The parameters C<$row> and C<$col> are used to specify the location of the split. It should be noted that the split is specified at the top or left of a cell and that the method uses zero based indexing. Therefore to freeze the first row of a worksheet it is necessary to specify the split at row 2 (which is 1 as the zero-based index). This might lead you to think that you are using a 1 based index but this is not the case.

You can set one of the C<$row> and C<$col> parameters as zero if you do not want either a vertical or horizontal split.

Examples:

    $worksheet->freeze_panes(1, 0); # Freeze the first row
    $worksheet->freeze_panes('A2'); # Same using A1 notation
    $worksheet->freeze_panes(0, 1); # Freeze the first column
    $worksheet->freeze_panes('B1'); # Same using A1 notation
    $worksheet->freeze_panes(1, 2); # Freeze first row and first 2 columns
    $worksheet->freeze_panes('C2'); # Same using A1 notation

The parameters C<$top_row> and C<$left_col> are optional. They are used to specify the top-most or left-most visible row or column in the scrolling region of the panes. For example to freeze the first row and to have the scrolling region begin at row twenty:

    $worksheet->freeze_panes(1, 0, 20, 0);

You cannot use A1 notation for the C<$top_row> and C<$left_col> parameters.


See also the C<panes.pl> program in the C<examples> directory of the distribution.




=head2 split_panes($y, $x, $top_row, $left_col)

This method can be used to divide a worksheet into horizontal or vertical regions known as panes. This method is different from the C<freeze_panes()> method in that the splits between the panes will be visible to the user and each pane will have its own scroll bars.

The parameters C<$y> and C<$x> are used to specify the vertical and horizontal position of the split. The units for C<$y> and C<$x> are the same as those used by Excel to specify row height and column width. However, the vertical and horizontal units are different from each other. Therefore you must specify the C<$y> and C<$x> parameters in terms of the row heights and column widths that you have set or the default values which are C<12.75> for a row and  C<8.43> for a column.

You can set one of the C<$y> and C<$x> parameters as zero if you do not want either a vertical or horizontal split. The parameters C<$top_row> and C<$left_col> are optional. They are used to specify the top-most or left-most visible row or column in the bottom-right pane.

Example:

    $worksheet->split_panes(12.75, 0,    1, 0); # First row
    $worksheet->split_panes(0,     8.43, 0, 1); # First column
    $worksheet->split_panes(12.75, 8.43, 1, 1); # First row and column

You cannot use A1 notation with this method.

See also the C<freeze_panes()> method and the C<panes.pl> program in the C<examples> directory of the distribution.


Note: This C<split_panes()> method was called C<thaw_panes()> in older versions. The older name is still available for backwards compatibility.



=head2 merge_range($first_row, $first_col, $last_row, $last_col, $token, $format)

Merging cells can be achieved by setting the C<merge> property of a Format object, see L<CELL FORMATTING>. However, this only allows simple Excel5 style horizontal merging which Excel refers to as "center across selection".

The C<merge_range()> method allows you to do Excel97+ style formatting where the cells can contain other types of alignment in addition to the merging:

    my $format = $workbook->add_format(
                                        border  => 6,
                                        valign  => 'vcenter',
                                        align   => 'center',
                                      );

    $worksheet->merge_range('B3:D4', 'Vertical and horizontal', $format);

C<merge_range()> writes its $token argument using the worksheet C<write()> method. Therefore it will handle numbers, strings, formulas or urls as required.

Setting the C<merge> property of the format isn't required when you are using C<merge_range()>. In fact using it will exclude the use of any other horizontal alignment option.

The full possibilities of this method are shown in the C<merge3.pl>, C<merge4.pl> and C<merge5.pl> programs in the C<examples> directory of the distribution.




=head2 set_zoom($scale)

B<Note:> This method is not yet supported by Excel::XLSX::Writer. See Spreadsheet::WriteExcel if you need this feature.

Set the worksheet zoom factor in the range C<10 E<lt>= $scale E<lt>= 400>:

    $worksheet1->set_zoom(50);
    $worksheet2->set_zoom(75);
    $worksheet3->set_zoom(300);
    $worksheet4->set_zoom(400);

The default zoom factor is 100. You cannot zoom to "Selection" because it is calculated by Excel at run-time.

Note, C<set_zoom()> does not affect the scale of the printed page. For that you should use C<set_print_scale()>.




=head2 autofilter($first_row, $first_col, $last_row, $last_col)

This method allows an autofilter to be added to a worksheet. An autofilter is a way of adding drop down lists to the headers of a 2D range of worksheet data. This is turn allow users to filter the data based on simple criteria so that some data is shown and some is hidden.

To add an autofilter to a worksheet:

    $worksheet->autofilter(0, 0, 10, 3);
    $worksheet->autofilter('A1:D11');    # Same as above in A1 notation.

Filter conditions can be applied using the C<filter_column()> method.

See the C<autofilter.pl> program in the examples directory of the distro for a more detailed example.




=head2 filter_column($column, $expression)


The C<filter_column> method can be used to filter columns in a autofilter range based on simple conditions.

The conditions for the filter are specified using simple expressions:

    $worksheet->filter_column('A', 'x > 2000');
    $worksheet->filter_column('B', 'x > 2000 and x < 5000');

The C<$column> parameter can either be a zero indexed column number or a string column name.

The following operators are available:

    Operator        Synonyms
       ==           =   eq  =~
       !=           <>  ne  !=
       >
       <
       >=
       <=

       and          &&
       or           ||

The operator synonyms are just syntactic sugar to make you more comfortable using the expressions. It is important to remember that the expressions will be interpreted by Excel and not by perl.

An expression can comprise a single statement or two statements separated by the C<and> and C<or> operators. For example:

    'x <  2000'
    'x >  2000'
    'x == 2000'
    'x >  2000 and x <  5000'
    'x == 2000 or  x == 5000'

Excel also allows some simple string matching operations:

    'x =~ b*'   # begins with b
    'x !~ b*'   # doesn't begin with b
    'x =~ *b'   # ends with b
    'x !~ *b'   # doesn't end with b
    'x =~ *b*'  # contains b
    'x !~ *b*'  # doesn't contains b

You can also use C<*> to match any character or number and C<?> to match any single character or number. No other regular expression quantifier is supported by Excel's filters. (Remember again that the expression is being interpreted by Excel and not by perl).

The placeholder variable C<x> in the above examples can be replaced by any simple string. The actual placeholder name is ignored internally so the following are all equivalent:

    'x     < 2000'
    'col   < 2000'
    'Price < 2000'

If you have problems with an expression, use Excel to create the condition that you want, save the file in XML format and examine the output.

Also, note that a filter condition can only be applied to a column in a range specified by the C<autofilter()> Worksheet method.

See the C<autofilter.pl> program in the examples directory of the distro for a more detailed example.




=head1 PAGE SET-UP METHODS

Page set-up methods affect the way that a worksheet looks when it is printed. They control features such as page headers and footers and margins. These methods are really just standard worksheet methods. They are documented here in a separate section for the sake of clarity.

The following methods are available for page set-up:

    set_landscape()
    set_portrait()
    set_paper()
    center_horizontally()
    center_vertically()
    set_margins()
    set_header()
    set_footer()
    repeat_rows()
    repeat_columns()
    hide_gridlines()
    print_row_col_headers()
    print_area()
    fit_to_pages()
    set_print_scale()
    set_h_pagebreaks()
    set_v_pagebreaks()

A common requirement when working with Excel::XLSX::Writer is to apply the same page set-up features to all of the worksheets in a workbook. To do this you can use the C<sheets()> method of the C<workbook> class to access the array of worksheets in a workbook:

    foreach $worksheet ($workbook->sheets()) {
       $worksheet->set_landscape();
    }




=head2 set_landscape()

This method is used to set the orientation of a worksheet's printed page to landscape:

    $worksheet->set_landscape(); # Landscape mode




=head2 set_portrait()

This method is used to set the orientation of a worksheet's printed page to portrait. The default worksheet orientation is portrait, so you won't generally need to call this method.

    $worksheet->set_portrait(); # Portrait mode



=head2 set_paper($index)

This method is used to set the paper format for the printed output of a worksheet. The following paper styles are available:

    Index   Paper format            Paper size
    =====   ============            ==========
      0     Printer default         -

Note, it is likely that not all of these paper types will be available to the end user since it will depend on the paper formats that the user's printer supports. Therefore, it is best to stick to standard paper types.

    $worksheet->set_paper(1); # US Letter
    $worksheet->set_paper(9); # A4

If you do not specify a paper type the worksheet will print using the printer's default paper.




=head2 center_horizontally()

Center the worksheet data horizontally between the margins on the printed page:

    $worksheet->center_horizontally();




=head2 center_vertically()

Center the worksheet data vertically between the margins on the printed page:

    $worksheet->center_vertically();




=head2 set_margins($inches)

There are several methods available for setting the worksheet margins on the printed page:

    set_margins()        # Set all margins to the same value
    set_margins_LR()     # Set left and right margins to the same value
    set_margins_TB()     # Set top and bottom margins to the same value
    set_margin_left();   # Set left margin
    set_margin_right();  # Set right margin
    set_margin_top();    # Set top margin
    set_margin_bottom(); # Set bottom margin

All of these methods take a distance in inches as a parameter. Note: 1 inch = 25.4mm. ;-) The default left and right margin is 0.75 inch. The default top and bottom margin is 1.00 inch.



=head2 set_header($string, $margin)

Headers and footers are generated using a C<$string> which is a combination of plain text and control characters. The C<$margin> parameter is optional.

The available control character are:

    Control             Category            Description
    =======             ========            ===========
    &L                  Justification       Left
    &C                                      Center
    &R                                      Right

    &P                  Information         Page number
    &N                                      Total number of pages
    &D                                      Date
    &T                                      Time
    &F                                      File name
    &A                                      Worksheet name
    &Z                                      Workbook path

    &fontsize           Font                Font size
    &"font,style"                           Font name and style
    &U                                      Single underline
    &E                                      Double underline
    &S                                      Strikethrough
    &X                                      Superscript
    &Y                                      Subscript

    &&                  Miscellaneous       Literal ampersand &


Text in headers and footers can be justified (aligned) to the left, center and right by prefixing the text with the control characters C<&L>, C<&C> and C<&R>.

For example (with ASCII art representation of the results):

    $worksheet->set_header('&LHello');

     ---------------------------------------------------------------
    |                                                               |
    | Hello                                                         |
    |                                                               |


    $worksheet->set_header('&CHello');

     ---------------------------------------------------------------
    |                                                               |
    |                          Hello                                |
    |                                                               |


    $worksheet->set_header('&RHello');

     ---------------------------------------------------------------
    |                                                               |
    |                                                         Hello |
    |                                                               |


For simple text, if you do not specify any justification the text will be centred. However, you must prefix the text with C<&C> if you specify a font name or any other formatting:

    $worksheet->set_header('Hello');

     ---------------------------------------------------------------
    |                                                               |
    |                          Hello                                |
    |                                                               |


You can have text in each of the justification regions:

    $worksheet->set_header('&LCiao&CBello&RCielo');

     ---------------------------------------------------------------
    |                                                               |
    | Ciao                     Bello                          Cielo |
    |                                                               |


The information control characters act as variables that Excel will update as the workbook or worksheet changes. Times and dates are in the users default format:

    $worksheet->set_header('&CPage &P of &N');

     ---------------------------------------------------------------
    |                                                               |
    |                        Page 1 of 6                            |
    |                                                               |


    $worksheet->set_header('&CUpdated at &T');

     ---------------------------------------------------------------
    |                                                               |
    |                    Updated at 12:30 PM                        |
    |                                                               |



You can specify the font size of a section of the text by prefixing it with the control character C<&n> where C<n> is the font size:

    $worksheet1->set_header('&C&30Hello Big'  );
    $worksheet2->set_header('&C&10Hello Small');

You can specify the font of a section of the text by prefixing it with the control sequence C<&"font,style"> where C<fontname> is a font name such as "Courier New" or "Times New Roman" and C<style> is one of the standard Windows font descriptions: "Regular", "Italic", "Bold" or "Bold Italic":

    $worksheet1->set_header('&C&"Courier New,Italic"Hello');
    $worksheet2->set_header('&C&"Courier New,Bold Italic"Hello');
    $worksheet3->set_header('&C&"Times New Roman,Regular"Hello');

It is possible to combine all of these features together to create sophisticated headers and footers. As an aid to setting up complicated headers and footers you can record a page set-up as a macro in Excel and look at the format strings that VBA produces. Remember however that VBA uses two double quotes C<""> to indicate a single double quote. For the last example above the equivalent VBA code looks like this:

    .LeftHeader   = ""
    .CenterHeader = "&""Times New Roman,Regular""Hello"
    .RightHeader  = ""


To include a single literal ampersand C<&> in a header or footer you should use a double ampersand C<&&>:

    $worksheet1->set_header('&CCuriouser && Curiouser - Attorneys at Law');

As stated above the margin parameter is optional. As with the other margins the value should be in inches. The default header and footer margin is 0.50 inch. The header and footer margin size can be set as follows:

    $worksheet->set_header('&CHello', 0.75);

The header and footer margins are independent of the top and bottom margins.

Note, the header or footer string must be less than 255 characters. Strings longer than this will not be written and a warning will be generated.

See, also the C<headers.pl> program in the C<examples> directory of the distribution.




=head2 set_footer()

The syntax of the C<set_footer()> method is the same as C<set_header()>,  see above.




=head2 repeat_rows($first_row, $last_row)

Set the number of rows to repeat at the top of each printed page.

For large Excel documents it is often desirable to have the first row or rows of the worksheet print out at the top of each page. This can be achieved by using the C<repeat_rows()> method. The parameters C<$first_row> and C<$last_row> are zero based. The C<$last_row> parameter is optional if you only wish to specify one row:

    $worksheet1->repeat_rows(0);    # Repeat the first row
    $worksheet2->repeat_rows(0, 1); # Repeat the first two rows




=head2 repeat_columns($first_col, $last_col)

Set the columns to repeat at the left hand side of each printed page.

For large Excel documents it is often desirable to have the first column or columns of the worksheet print out at the left hand side of each page. This can be achieved by using the C<repeat_columns()> method. The parameters C<$first_column> and C<$last_column> are zero based. The C<$last_column> parameter is optional if you only wish to specify one column. You can also specify the columns using A1 column notation, see the note about L<Cell notation>.

    $worksheet1->repeat_columns(0);     # Repeat the first column
    $worksheet2->repeat_columns(0, 1);  # Repeat the first two columns
    $worksheet3->repeat_columns('A:A'); # Repeat the first column
    $worksheet4->repeat_columns('A:B'); # Repeat the first two columns



=head2 print_gridlines()

Turn on printed gridlines. These are off by default in the Excel XML format. *

    $worksheet->print_gridlines();


* They are also off by default in the Excel97+ versions but Spreadsheet::WriteExcel turns them on for backward compatibility reasons.




=head2 hide_gridlines($option)

This method is used to hide the gridlines on the screen and printed page. Gridlines are the lines that divide the cells on a worksheet. If you have defined your own cell borders you may wish to hide the default gridlines.

    $worksheet->hide_gridlines();

The following values of C<$option> are valid:

    0 : Don't hide gridlines
    1 : Hide printed gridlines only
    2 : Hide screen and printed gridlines

If you don't supply an argument or use C<undef> the default option is 1, i.e. only the printed gridlines are hidden.




=head2 print_row_col_headers()

Set the option to print the row and column headers on the printed page.

An Excel worksheet looks something like the following;

     ------------------------------------------
    |   |   A   |   B   |   C   |   D   |  ...
     ------------------------------------------
    | 1 |       |       |       |       |  ...
    | 2 |       |       |       |       |  ...
    | 3 |       |       |       |       |  ...
    | 4 |       |       |       |       |  ...
    |...|  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |  ...

The headers are the letters and numbers at the top and the left of the worksheet. Since these headers serve mainly as a indication of position on the worksheet they generally do not appear on the printed page. If you wish to have them printed you can use the C<print_row_col_headers()> method :

    $worksheet->print_row_col_headers()

Do not confuse these headers with page headers as described in the C<set_header()> section above.




=head2 print_area($first_row, $first_col, $last_row, $last_col)

This method is used to specify the area of the worksheet that will be printed. All four parameters must be specified. You can also use A1 notation, see the note about L<Cell notation>.


    $worksheet1->print_area('A1:H20');    # Cells A1 to H20
    $worksheet2->print_area(0, 0, 19, 7); # The same
    $worksheet2->print_area('A:H');       # Columns A to H if rows have data



=head2 fit_to_pages($width, $height)

The C<fit_to_pages()> method is used to fit the printed area to a specific number of pages both vertically and horizontally. If the printed area exceeds the specified number of pages it will be scaled down to fit. This guarantees that the printed area will always appear on the specified number of pages even if the page size or margins change.

    $worksheet1->fit_to_pages(1, 1); # Fit to 1x1 pages
    $worksheet2->fit_to_pages(2, 1); # Fit to 2x1 pages
    $worksheet3->fit_to_pages(1, 2); # Fit to 1x2 pages

The print area can be defined using the C<print_area()> method as described above.

A common requirement is to fit the printed output to I<n> pages wide but have the height be as long as necessary. To achieve this set the C<$height> to zero or leave it blank:

    $worksheet1->fit_to_pages(1, 0); # 1 page wide and as long as necessary
    $worksheet2->fit_to_pages(1);    # The same


Note that although it is valid to use both C<fit_to_pages()> and C<set_print_scale()> on the same worksheet only one of these options can be active at a time. The last method call made will set the active option.

Note that C<fit_to_pages()> will override any manual page breaks that are defined in the worksheet.




=head2 set_print_scale($scale)

Set the scale factor of the printed page. Scale factors in the range C<10 E<lt>= $scale E<lt>= 400> are valid:

    $worksheet1->set_print_scale(50);
    $worksheet2->set_print_scale(75);
    $worksheet3->set_print_scale(300);
    $worksheet4->set_print_scale(400);

The default scale factor is 100. Note, C<set_print_scale()> does not affect the scale of the visible page in Excel. For that you should use C<set_zoom()>.

Note also that although it is valid to use both C<fit_to_pages()> and C<set_print_scale()> on the same worksheet only one of these options can be active at a time. The last method call made will set the active option.




=head2 set_h_pagebreaks(@breaks)

Add horizontal page breaks to a worksheet. A page break causes all the data that follows it to be printed on the next page. Horizontal page breaks act between rows. To create a page break between rows 20 and 21 you must specify the break at row 21. However in zero index notation this is actually row 20. So you can pretend for a small while that you are using 1 index notation:

    $worksheet1->set_h_pagebreaks(20); # Break between row 20 and 21

The C<set_h_pagebreaks()> method will accept a list of page breaks and you can call it more than once:

    $worksheet2->set_h_pagebreaks( 20,  40,  60,  80, 100); # Add breaks
    $worksheet2->set_h_pagebreaks(120, 140, 160, 180, 200); # Add some more

Note: If you specify the "fit to page" option via the C<fit_to_pages()> method it will override all manual page breaks.

There is a silent limitation of about 1000 horizontal page breaks per worksheet in line with an Excel internal limitation.




=head2 set_v_pagebreaks(@breaks)

Add vertical page breaks to a worksheet. A page break causes all the data that follows it to be printed on the next page. Vertical page breaks act between columns. To create a page break between columns 20 and 21 you must specify the break at column 21. However in zero index notation this is actually column 20. So you can pretend for a small while that you are using 1 index notation:

    $worksheet1->set_v_pagebreaks(20); # Break between column 20 and 21

The C<set_v_pagebreaks()> method will accept a list of page breaks and you can call it more than once:

    $worksheet2->set_v_pagebreaks( 20,  40,  60,  80, 100); # Add breaks
    $worksheet2->set_v_pagebreaks(120, 140, 160, 180, 200); # Add some more

Note: If you specify the "fit to page" option via the C<fit_to_pages()> method it will override all manual page breaks.




=head1 CELL FORMATTING

This section describes the methods and properties that are available for formatting cells in Excel. The properties of a cell that can be formatted include: fonts, colours, patterns, borders, alignment and number formatting.


=head2 Creating and using a Format object

Cell formatting is defined through a Format object. Format objects are created by calling the workbook C<add_format()> method as follows:

    my $format1 = $workbook->add_format();       # Set properties later
    my $format2 = $workbook->add_format(%props); # Set at creation

The format object holds all the formatting properties that can be applied to a cell, a row or a column. The process of setting these properties is discussed in the next section.

Once a Format object has been constructed and it properties have been set it can be passed as an argument to the worksheet C<write> methods as follows:

    $worksheet->write(0, 0, 'One', $format);
    $worksheet->write_string(1, 0, 'Two', $format);
    $worksheet->write_number(2, 0, 3, $format);
    $worksheet->write_blank(3, 0, $format);

Formats can also be passed to the worksheet C<set_row()> and C<set_column()> methods to define the default property for a row or column.

    $worksheet->set_row(0, 15, $format);
    $worksheet->set_column(0, 0, 15, $format);




=head2 Format methods and Format properties

The following table shows the Excel format categories, the formatting properties that can be applied and the equivalent object method:


    Category   Description       Property        Method Name
    --------   -----------       --------        -----------

               Left color        left_color      set_left_color()
               Right color       right_color     set_right_color()

There are two ways of setting Format properties: by using the object method interface or by setting the property directly. For example, a typical use of the method interface would be as follows:

    my $format = $workbook->add_format();
    $format->set_bold();
    $format->set_color('red');

By comparison the properties can be set directly by passing a hash of properties to the Format constructor:

    my $format = $workbook->add_format(bold => 1, color => 'red');

or after the Format has been constructed by means of the C<set_properties()> method as follows:

    my $format = $workbook->add_format();
    $format->set_properties(bold => 1, color => 'red');

You can also store the properties in one or more named hashes and pass them to the required method:

    my %font    = (
                    font  => 'Arial',
                    size  => 12,
                    color => 'blue',
                    bold  => 1,
                  );

    my %shading = (
                    bg_color => 'green',
                    pattern  => 1,
                  );


    my $format1 = $workbook->add_format(%font);           # Font only
    my $format2 = $workbook->add_format(%font, %shading); # Font and shading


The provision of two ways of setting properties might lead you to wonder which is the best way. The method mechanism may be better is you prefer setting properties via method calls (which the author did when they were code was first written) otherwise passing properties to the constructor has proved to be a little more flexible and self documenting in practice. An additional advantage of working with property hashes is that it allows you to share formatting between workbook objects as shown in the example above.

The Perl/Tk style of adding properties is also supported:

    my %font    = (
                    -font  => 'Arial',
                    -size  => 12,
                    -color => 'blue',
                    -bold  => 1,
                  );




=head2 Working with formats

The default format is Arial 10 with all other properties off.

Each unique format in Excel::XLSX::Writer must have a corresponding Format object. It isn't possible to use a Format with a write() method and then redefine the Format for use at a later stage. This is because a Format is applied to a cell not in its current state but in its final state. Consider the following example:

    my $format = $workbook->add_format();
    $format->set_bold();
    $format->set_color('red');
    $worksheet->write('A1', 'Cell A1', $format);
    $format->set_color('green');
    $worksheet->write('B1', 'Cell B1', $format);

Cell A1 is assigned the Format C<$format> which is initially set to the colour red. However, the colour is subsequently set to green. When Excel displays Cell A1 it will display the final state of the Format which in this case will be the colour green.

In general a method call without an argument will turn a property on, for example:

    my $format1 = $workbook->add_format();
    $format1->set_bold();  # Turns bold on
    $format1->set_bold(1); # Also turns bold on
    $format1->set_bold(0); # Turns bold off




=head1 FORMAT METHODS

The Format object methods are described in more detail in the following sections. In addition, there is a Perl program called C<formats.pl> in the C<examples> directory of the WriteExcelXML distribution. This program creates an Excel workbook called C<formats.xls> which contains examples of almost all the format types.

The following Format methods are available:

    set_font()
    set_size()
    set_color()
    set_bold()
    set_italic()
    set_underline()
    set_font_strikeout()
    set_font_script()
    set_font_outline()
    set_font_shadow()
    set_num_format()
    set_locked()
    set_hidden()
    set_align()
    set_align()
    set_rotation()
    set_text_wrap()
    set_text_justlast()
    set_center_across()
    set_indent()
    set_shrink()
    set_pattern()
    set_bg_color()
    set_fg_color()
    set_border()
    set_bottom()
    set_top()
    set_left()
    set_right()
    set_border_color()
    set_bottom_color()
    set_top_color()
    set_left_color()
    set_right_color()


The above methods can also be applied directly as properties. For example C<$worksheet-E<gt>set_bold()> is equivalent to C<set_properties(bold =E<gt> 1)>.


=head2 set_properties(%properties)

The properties of an existing Format object can be set by means of C<set_properties()>:

    my $format = $workbook->add_format();
    $format->set_properties(bold => 1, color => 'red');

You can also store the properties in one or more named hashes and pass them to the C<set_properties()> method:

    my %font    = (
                    font  => 'Arial',
                    size  => 12,
                    color => 'blue',
                    bold  => 1,
                  );

    my $format = $workbook->set_properties(%font);

This method can be used as an alternative to setting the properties with C<add_format()> or the specific format methods that are detailed in the following sections.




=head2 set_font($fontname)

    Default state:      Font is Arial
    Default action:     None
    Valid args:         Any valid font name

Specify the font used:

    $format->set_font('Times New Roman');

Excel can only display fonts that are installed on the system that it is running on. Therefore it is best to use the fonts that come as standard such as 'Arial', 'Times New Roman' and 'Courier New'. See also the Fonts worksheet created by formats.pl




=head2 set_size()

    Default state:      Font size is 10
    Default action:     Set font size to 1
    Valid args:         Integer values from 1 to as big as your screen.


Set the font size. Excel adjusts the height of a row to accommodate the largest font size in the row. You can also explicitly specify the height of a row using the set_row() worksheet method.

    my $format = $workbook->add_format();
    $format->set_size(30);





=head2 set_color()

    Default state:      Excels default color, usually black
    Default action:     Set the default color
    Valid args:         Integers from 8..63 or the following strings:
                        'black'
                        'blue'
                        'brown'
                        'cyan'
                        'gray'
                        'green'
                        'lime'
                        'magenta'
                        'navy'
                        'orange'
                        'purple'
                        'red'
                        'silver'
                        'white'
                        'yellow'

Set the font colour. The C<set_color()> method is used as follows:

    my $format = $workbook->add_format();
    $format->set_color('red');
    $worksheet->write(0, 0, 'wheelbarrow', $format);

Note: The C<set_color()> method is used to set the colour of the font in a cell. To set the colour of a cell use the C<set_bg_color()> and C<set_pattern()> methods.

For additional examples see the 'Named colors' and 'Standard colors' worksheets created by formats.pl in the examples directory.

See also L<COLOURS IN EXCEL>.




=head2 set_bold()

    Default state:      bold is off
    Default action:     Turn bold on
    Valid args:         0, 1 [1]

Set the bold property of the font:

    $format->set_bold();  # Turn bold on

[1] Actually, values in the range 100..1000 are also valid. 400 is normal, 700 is bold and 1000 is very bold indeed. It is probably best to set the value to 1 and use normal bold.




=head2 set_italic()

    Default state:      Italic is off
    Default action:     Turn italic on
    Valid args:         0, 1

Set the italic property of the font:

    $format->set_italic();  # Turn italic on




=head2 set_underline()

    Default state:      Underline is off
    Default action:     Turn on single underline
    Valid args:         0  = No underline
                        1  = Single underline
                        2  = Double underline
                        33 = Single accounting underline
                        34 = Double accounting underline

Set the underline property of the font.

    $format->set_underline();   # Single underline




=head2 set_font_strikeout()

    Default state:      Strikeout is off
    Default action:     Turn strikeout on
    Valid args:         0, 1

Set the strikeout property of the font.




=head2 set_font_script()

    Default state:      Super/Subscript is off
    Default action:     Turn Superscript on
    Valid args:         0  = Normal
                        1  = Superscript
                        2  = Subscript

Set the superscript/subscript property of the font. This format is currently not very useful.




=head2 set_font_outline()

    Default state:      Outline is off
    Default action:     Turn outline on
    Valid args:         0, 1

Macintosh only.




=head2 set_font_shadow()

    Default state:      Shadow is off
    Default action:     Turn shadow on
    Valid args:         0, 1

Macintosh only.




=head2 set_num_format()

    Default state:      General format
    Default action:     Format index 1
    Valid args:         See the following table

This method is used to define the numerical format of a number in Excel. It controls whether a number is displayed as an integer, a floating point number, a date, a currency value or some other user defined format.

The numerical format of a cell can be specified by using a format string or an index to one of Excel's built-in formats:

    my $format1 = $workbook->add_format();
    my $format2 = $workbook->add_format();
    $format1->set_num_format('d mmm yyyy'); # Format string
    $format2->set_num_format(0x0f);         # Format index

    $worksheet->write(0, 0, 36892.521, $format1);      # 1 Jan 2001
    $worksheet->write(0, 0, 36892.521, $format2);      # 1-Jan-01


Using format strings you can define very sophisticated formatting of numbers.

    $format01->set_num_format('0.000');
    $worksheet->write(0,  0, 3.1415926, $format01);    # 3.142

    $format02->set_num_format('#,##0');
    $worksheet->write(1,  0, 1234.56,   $format02);    # 1,235

    $format03->set_num_format('#,##0.00');
    $worksheet->write(2,  0, 1234.56,   $format03);    # 1,234.56

    $format04->set_num_format('$0.00');
    $worksheet->write(3,  0, 49.99,     $format04);    # $49.99

    # Note you can use other currency symbols such as the pound or yen as well.
    # Other currencies may require the use of Unicode.

    $format07->set_num_format('mm/dd/yy');
    $worksheet->write(6,  0, 36892.521, $format07);    # 01/01/01

    $format08->set_num_format('mmm d yyyy');
    $worksheet->write(7,  0, 36892.521, $format08);    # Jan 1 2001

    $format09->set_num_format('d mmmm yyyy');
    $worksheet->write(8,  0, 36892.521, $format09);    # 1 January 2001

    $format10->set_num_format('dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm AM/PM');
    $worksheet->write(9,  0, 36892.521, $format10);    # 01/01/2001 12:30 AM

    $format11->set_num_format('0 "dollar and" .00 "cents"');
    $worksheet->write(10, 0, 1.87,      $format11);    # 1 dollar and .87 cents

    # Conditional formatting
    $format12->set_num_format('[Green]General;[Red]-General;General');
    $worksheet->write(11, 0, 123,       $format12);    # > 0 Green
    $worksheet->write(12, 0, -45,       $format12);    # < 0 Red
    $worksheet->write(13, 0, 0,         $format12);    # = 0 Default colour

    # Zip code
    $format13->set_num_format('00000');
    $worksheet->write(14, 0, '01209',   $format13);


The number system used for dates is described in L<DATES IN EXCEL>.

The colour format should have one of the following values:

    [Black] [Blue] [Cyan] [Green] [Magenta] [Red] [White] [Yellow]

Alternatively you can specify the colour based on a colour index as follows: C<[Color n]>, where n is a standard Excel colour index - 7. See the 'Standard colors' worksheet created by formats.pl.

For more information refer to the documentation on formatting in the C<doc> directory of the Excel::XLSX::Writer distro, the Excel on-line help or to the tutorial at: http://support.microsoft.com/support/Excel/Content/Formats/default.asp and http://support.microsoft.com/support/Excel/Content/Formats/codes.asp

You should ensure that the format string is valid in Excel prior to using it in WriteExcelXML.

The following Excel XML number format designations can be used in formats:

    'General'
    'General Number'
    'General Date'
    'Long Date'
    'Medium Date'
    'Short Date'
    'Long Time'
    'Medium Time'
    'Short Time'
    'Currency'
    'Euro Currency'
    'Fixed'
    'Standard'
    'Percent'
    'Scientific'
    'Yes/No'
    'True/False'
    'On/Off'


Excel's built-in formats are shown in the following table:

    Index   Index   Format String
    0       0x00    General
    1       0x01    0

For examples of these formatting codes see the 'Numerical formats' worksheet created by formats.pl. See also the number_formats1.html and the number_formats2.html documents in the C<doc> directory of the distro.

Note 1. Numeric formats 23 to 36 are not documented by Microsoft and may differ in international versions.

Note 2. In Excel 5 the dollar sign appears as a dollar sign. In Excel 97-2000 it appears as the defined local currency symbol.

Note 3. The red negative numeric formats display slightly differently in Excel 5 and Excel 97-2000.




=head2 set_locked()

    Default state:      Cell locking is on
    Default action:     Turn locking on
    Valid args:         0, 1

This property can be used to prevent modification of a cells contents. Following Excel's convention, cell locking is turned on by default. However, it only has an effect if the worksheet has been protected, see the worksheet C<protect()> method.

    my $locked  = $workbook->add_format();
    $locked->set_locked(1); # A non-op

    my $unlocked = $workbook->add_format();
    $locked->set_locked(0);

    # Enable worksheet protection
    $worksheet->protect();

    # This cell cannot be edited.
    $worksheet->write('A1', '=1+2', $locked);

    # This cell can be edited.
    $worksheet->write('A2', '=1+2', $unlocked);

Note: This offers weak protection even with a password, see the note in relation to the C<protect()> method.




=head2 set_hidden()

    Default state:      Formula hiding is off
    Default action:     Turn hiding on
    Valid args:         0, 1

This property is used to hide a formula while still displaying its result. This is generally used to hide complex calculations from end users who are only interested in the result. It only has an effect if the worksheet has been protected, see the worksheet C<protect()> method.

    my $hidden = $workbook->add_format();
    $hidden->set_hidden();

    # Enable worksheet protection
    $worksheet->protect();

    # The formula in this cell isn't visible
    $worksheet->write('A1', '=1+2', $hidden);


Note: This offers weak protection even with a password, see the note in relation to the C<protect()> method.




=head2 set_align()

    Default state:      Alignment is off
    Default action:     Left alignment
    Valid args:         'left'              Horizontal
                        'center'
                        'right'
                        'fill'
                        'justify'
                        'center_across'

                        'top'               Vertical
                        'vcenter'
                        'bottom'
                        'vjustify'

This method is used to set the horizontal and vertical text alignment within a cell. Vertical and horizontal alignments can be combined. The method is used as follows:

    my $format = $workbook->add_format();
    $format->set_align('center');
    $format->set_align('vcenter');
    $worksheet->set_row(0, 30);
    $worksheet->write(0, 0, 'X', $format);

Text can be aligned across two or more adjacent cells using the C<center_across> property. However, for genuine merged cells it is better to use the C<merge_range()> worksheet method.

The C<vjustify> (vertical justify) option can be used to provide automatic text wrapping in a cell. The height of the cell will be adjusted to accommodate the wrapped text. To specify where the text wraps use the C<set_text_wrap()> method.


For further examples see the 'Alignment' worksheet created by formats.pl.




=head2 set_center_across()

    Default state:      Center across selection is off
    Default action:     Turn center across on
    Valid args:         1

Text can be aligned across two or more adjacent cells using the C<set_center_across()> method. This is an alias for the C<set_align('center_across')> method call.

Only one cell should contain the text, the other cells should be blank:

    my $format = $workbook->add_format();
    $format->set_center_across();

    $worksheet->write(1, 1, 'Center across selection', $format);
    $worksheet->write_blank(1, 2, $format);

See also the C<merge1.pl> to C<merge5.pl> programs in the C<examples> directory and the C<merge_range()> method.



=head2 set_text_wrap()

    Default state:      Text wrap is off
    Default action:     Turn text wrap on
    Valid args:         0, 1


Here is an example using the text wrap property, the escape character C<\n> is used to indicate the end of line:

    my $format = $workbook->add_format();
    $format->set_text_wrap();
    $worksheet->write(0, 0, "It's\na bum\nwrap", $format);

Excel will adjust the height of the row to accommodate the wrapped text. A similar effect can be obtained without newlines using the C<set_align('vjustify')> method. See the C<textwrap.pl> program in the C<examples> directory.




=head2 set_rotation()

    Default state:      Text rotation is off
    Default action:     None
    Valid args:         Integers in the range -90 to 90 and 270

Set the rotation of the text in a cell. The rotation can be any angle in the range -90 to 90 degrees.

    my $format = $workbook->add_format();
    $format->set_rotation(30);
    $worksheet->write(0, 0, 'This text is rotated', $format);


The angle 270 is also supported. This indicates text where the letters run from top to bottom.



=head2 set_indent()


    Default state:      Text indentation is off
    Default action:     Indent text 1 level
    Valid args:         Positive integers


This method can be used to indent text. The argument, which should be an integer, is taken as the level of indentation:


    my $format = $workbook->add_format();
    $format->set_indent(2);
    $worksheet->write(0, 0, 'This text is indented', $format);


Indentation is a horizontal alignment property. It will override any other horizontal properties but it can be used in conjunction with vertical properties.




=head2 set_shrink()


    Default state:      Text shrinking is off
    Default action:     Turn "shrink to fit" on
    Valid args:         1


This method can be used to shrink text so that it fits in a cell.


    my $format = $workbook->add_format();
    $format->set_shrink();
    $worksheet->write(0, 0, 'Honey, I shrunk the text!', $format);




=head2 set_text_justlast()

    Default state:      Justify last is off
    Default action:     Turn justify last on
    Valid args:         0, 1


Only applies to Far Eastern versions of Excel.




=head2 set_pattern()

    Default state:      Pattern is off
    Default action:     Solid fill is on
    Valid args:         0 .. 18

Set the background pattern of a cell.

Examples of the available patterns are shown in the 'Patterns' worksheet created by formats.pl. However, it is unlikely that you will ever need anything other than Pattern 1 which is a solid fill of the background color.




=head2 set_bg_color()

    Default state:      Color is off
    Default action:     Solid fill.
    Valid args:         See set_color()

The C<set_bg_color()> method can be used to set the background colour of a pattern. Patterns are defined via the C<set_pattern()> method. If a pattern hasn't been defined then a solid fill pattern is used as the default.

Here is an example of how to set up a solid fill in a cell:

    my $format = $workbook->add_format();

    $format->set_pattern(); # This is optional when using a solid fill

    $format->set_bg_color('green');
    $worksheet->write('A1', 'Ray', $format);

For further examples see the 'Patterns' worksheet created by formats.pl.




=head2 set_fg_color()

    Default state:      Color is off
    Default action:     Solid fill.
    Valid args:         See set_color()


The C<set_fg_color()> method can be used to set the foreground colour of a pattern.

For further examples see the 'Patterns' worksheet created by formats.pl.




=head2 set_border()

    Also applies to:    set_bottom()
                        set_top()
                        set_left()
                        set_right()

    Default state:      Border is off
    Default action:     Set border type 1
    Valid args:         0 No border
                        1 Thin single border
                        2 Medium single border
                        3 Dashed border
                        4 Dotted border
                        5 Thick single border
                        6 Double line border
                        7 Hair border


A cell border is comprised of a border on the bottom, top, left and right. These can be set to the same value using C<set_border()> or individually using the relevant method calls shown above. Examples of the available border styles are shown in the 'Borders' worksheet created by formats.pl.




=head2 set_border_color()

    Also applies to:    set_bottom_color()
                        set_top_color()
                        set_left_color()
                        set_right_color()

    Default state:      Color is off
    Default action:     Undefined
    Valid args:         See set_color()


Set the colour of the cell borders. A cell border is comprised of a border on the bottom, top, left and right. These can be set to the same colour using C<set_border_color()> or individually using the relevant method calls shown above. Examples of the border styles and colours are shown in the 'Borders' worksheet created by formats.pl.





=head2 copy($format)


This method is used to copy all of the properties from one Format object to another:

    my $lorry1 = $workbook->add_format();
    $lorry1->set_bold();
    $lorry1->set_italic();
    $lorry1->set_color('red');    # lorry1 is bold, italic and red

    my $lorry2 = $workbook->add_format();
    $lorry2->copy($lorry1);
    $lorry2->set_color('yellow'); # lorry2 is bold, italic and yellow

The C<copy()> method is only useful if you are using the method interface to Format properties. It generally isn't required if you are setting Format properties directly using hashes.


Note: this is not a copy constructor, both objects must exist prior to copying.




=head1 COLOURS IN EXCEL

B<Note:> This method is not yet supported by Excel::XLSX::Writer. See Spreadsheet::WriteExcel if you need this feature.


Excel provides a colour palette of 56 colours. In Excel::XLSX::Writer these colours are accessed via their palette index in the range 8..63. This index is used to set the colour of fonts, cell patterns and cell borders. For example:

    my $format = $workbook->add_format(
                                        color => 12, # index for blue
                                        font  => 'Arial',
                                        size  => 12,
                                        bold  => 1,
                                     );

The most commonly used colours can also be accessed by name. The name acts as a simple alias for the colour index:

    black     =>    8
    blue      =>   12
    brown     =>   16
    cyan      =>   15
    gray      =>   23
    green     =>   17
    lime      =>   11
    magenta   =>   14
    navy      =>   18
    orange    =>   53
    purple    =>   20
    red       =>   10
    silver    =>   22
    white     =>    9
    yellow    =>   13

For example:

    my $font = $workbook->add_format(color => 'red');

Users of VBA in Excel should note that the equivalent colour indices are in the range 1..56 instead of 8..63.

If the default palette does not provide a required colour you can override one of the built-in values. This is achieved by using the C<set_custom_color()> workbook method to adjust the RGB (red green blue) components of the colour:

    my $ferrari = $workbook->set_custom_color(40, 216, 12, 12);

    my $format  = $workbook->add_format(
                                        bg_color => $ferrari,
                                        pattern  => 1,
                                        border   => 1
                                      );

    $worksheet->write_blank('A1', $format);

The default Excel colour palette is shown in C<palette.html> in the C<doc> directory of the distro. You can generate an Excel version of the palette using C<colors.pl> in the C<examples> directory.



=head1 DATES IN EXCEL

The following methods  will work with Excel::XLSX::Writer but they apply more to Spreadsheet::WriteExcel since Excel XML has another relatively simpler method of dealing with dates. See the C<write_date_time()> Worksheet method.

Dates and times in Excel are represented by real numbers, for example "Jan 1 2001 12:30 AM" is represented by the number 36892.521.

The integer part of the number stores the number of days since the epoch and the fractional part stores the percentage of the day.

The epoch can be either 1900 or 1904. Excel for Windows uses 1900 and Excel for Macintosh uses 1904. The epochs are:

    1900: 0 January 1900 i.e. 31 December 1899
    1904: 1 January 1904

By default Excel::XLSX::Writer uses the Windows/1900 format although it generally isn't an issue since Excel on Windows and the Macintosh will convert automatically between one system and the other. To use the 1904 epoch you must use the C<set_1904()> workbook method.

There are two things to note about the 1900 date format. The first is that the epoch starts on 0 January 1900. The second is that the year 1900 is erroneously but deliberately treated as a leap year. Therefore you must add an extra day to dates after 28 February 1900. The reason for this anomaly is explained at http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q181/3/70.asp

A date or time in Excel is like any other number. To display the number as a date you must apply a number format to it. Refer to the C<set_num_format()> method above:

    $format->set_num_format('mmm d yyyy hh:mm AM/PM');
    $worksheet->write('A1', 36892.521 , $format); # Jan 1 2001 12:30 AM


The C<Excel::XLSX::Writer::Utility> module that is included in the distro contains helper functions for dealing with dates and times in Excel, for example:

    $date = xl_date_list(2002, 1, 1);         # 37257
    $date = xl_parse_date("11 July 1997");    # 35622
    $time = xl_parse_time('3:21:36 PM');      # 0.64
    $date = xl_decode_date_EU("13 May 2002"); # 37389

These functions deal automatically with the s1900 leap year issue described above.

The date and time functions are based on functions provided by the C<Date::Calc> and C<Date::Manip> modules. These modules are very useful if you plan to manipulate dates in different formats.

See also the DateTime::Format::Excel module,http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=DateTime-Format-Excel which is part of the DateTime project and which deals specifically with converting dates and times to and from Excel's format.

There is also the C<excel_date1.pl> program in the C<examples> directory of the WriteExcelXML distribution which was written by Andrew Benham. It contains a detailed description of the problems involved in calculating dates in Excel. It does not require any external modules.

It is also possible to get Excel to calculate dates for you by defining a function:

    $worksheet->write('A1', '=DATEVALUE("1-Jan-2001")');

However, this carries a performance overhead in Excel::XLSX::Writer due to the parsing of the formula and it shouldn't be used for programs that deal with a large number of dates, unless you use it in conjunction with C<store_formula()> and C<repeat_formula()> .




=head1 OUTLINES AND GROUPING IN EXCEL

B<Note:> Outlines and Grouping is not supported by Excel XML. See Spreadsheet::WriteExcel if you need this feature.


Excel allows you to group rows or columns so that they can be hidden or displayed with a single mouse click. This feature is referred to as outlines.

Outlines can reduce complex data down to a few salient sub-totals or summaries.

This feature is best viewed in Excel but the following is an ASCII representation of what a worksheet with three outlines might look like. Rows 3-4 and rows 7-8 are grouped at level 2. Rows 2-9 are grouped at level 1. The lines at the left hand side are called outline level bars.


            ------------------------------------------
     1 2 3 |   |   A   |   B   |   C   |   D   |  ...
            ------------------------------------------
      _    | 1 |   A   |       |       |       |  ...
     |  _  | 2 |   B   |       |       |       |  ...
     | |   | 3 |  (C)  |       |       |       |  ...
     | |   | 4 |  (D)  |       |       |       |  ...
     | -   | 5 |   E   |       |       |       |  ...
     |  _  | 6 |   F   |       |       |       |  ...
     | |   | 7 |  (G)  |       |       |       |  ...
     | |   | 8 |  (H)  |       |       |       |  ...
     | -   | 9 |   I   |       |       |       |  ...
     -     | . |  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |  ...


Clicking the minus sign on each of the level 2 outlines will collapse and hide the data as shown in the next figure. The minus sign changes to a plus sign to indicate that the data in the outline is hidden.

            ------------------------------------------
     1 2 3 |   |   A   |   B   |   C   |   D   |  ...
            ------------------------------------------
      _    | 1 |   A   |       |       |       |  ...
     |     | 2 |   B   |       |       |       |  ...
     | +   | 5 |   E   |       |       |       |  ...
     |     | 6 |   F   |       |       |       |  ...
     | +   | 9 |   I   |       |       |       |  ...
     -     | . |  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |  ...


Clicking on the minus sign on the level 1 outline will collapse the remaining rows as follows:

            ------------------------------------------
     1 2 3 |   |   A   |   B   |   C   |   D   |  ...
            ------------------------------------------
           | 1 |   A   |       |       |       |  ...
     +     | . |  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |  ...  |  ...


Grouping in C<Excel::XLSX::Writer> is achieved by setting the outline level via the C<set_row()> and C<set_column()> worksheet methods:

    set_row($row, $height, $format, $hidden, $level)
    set_column($first_col, $last_col, $width, $format, $hidden, $level)

The following example sets an outline level of 1 for rows 1 and 2 (zero-indexed) and columns B to G. The parameters C<$height> and C<$XF> are assigned default values since they are undefined:

    $worksheet->set_row(1, undef, undef, 0, 1);
    $worksheet->set_row(2, undef, undef, 0, 1);
    $worksheet->set_column('B:G', undef, undef, 0, 1);

Excel allows up to 7 outline levels. Therefore the C<$level> parameter should be in the range C<0 E<lt>= $level E<lt>= 7>.

Rows and columns can be collapsed by setting the C<$hidden> flag:

    $worksheet->set_row(1, undef, undef, 1, 1);
    $worksheet->set_row(2, undef, undef, 1, 1);
    $worksheet->set_column('B:G', undef, undef, 1, 1);

For a more complete example see the C<outline.pl> program in the examples directory of the distro.

Some additional outline properties can be set via the C<outline_settings()> worksheet method, see above.




=head1 FORMULAS AND FUNCTIONS IN EXCEL


=head2 Caveats

The first thing to note is that there are still some outstanding issues with the implementation of formulas and functions:

    1. Named ranges are not supported.

However, this and other constraints will be removed in future versions. They are here because of a trade-off between features and time.



=head2 Introduction

The following is a brief introduction to formulas and functions in Excel and Excel::XLSX::Writer.

A formula is a string that begins with an equals sign:

    '=A1+B1'
    '=AVERAGE(1, 2, 3)'

The formula can contain numbers, strings, boolean values, cell references, cell ranges and functions. Named ranges are not supported. Formulas should be written as they appear in Excel, that is cells and functions must be in uppercase.

Cells in Excel are referenced using the A1 notation system where the column is designated by a letter and the row by a number. Columns range from A to XFD i.e. 0 to 16384, rows range from 1 to 1048576. When the C<use_lower_cell_limits()> method is used the columns range from A to IV, 0 to 255 and  rows range from 1 to 65536.



 The C<Excel::XLSX::Writer::Utility> module that is included in the distro contains helper functions for dealing with A1 notation, for example:

    use Excel::XLSX::Writer::Utility;

    ($row, $col) = xl_cell_to_rowcol('C2');  # (1, 2)
    $str         = xl_rowcol_to_cell(1, 2);  # C2

The Excel C<$> notation in cell references is also supported. This allows you to specify whether a row or column is relative or absolute. This only has an effect if the cell is copied. The following examples show relative and absolute values.

    '=A1'   # Column and row are relative
    '=$A1'  # Column is absolute and row is relative
    '=A$1'  # Column is relative and row is absolute
    '=$A$1' # Column and row are absolute

Formulas can also refer to cells in other worksheets of the current workbook. For example:

    '=Sheet2!A1'
    '=Sheet2!A1:A5'
    '=Sheet2:Sheet3!A1'
    '=Sheet2:Sheet3!A1:A5'
    q{='Test Data'!A1}
    q{='Test Data1:Test Data2'!A1}

The sheet reference and the cell reference are separated by  C<!> the exclamation mark symbol. If worksheet names contain spaces, commas o parentheses then Excel requires that the name is enclosed in single quotes as shown in the last two examples above. In order to avoid using a lot of escape characters you can use the quote operator C<q{}> to protect the quotes. See C<perlop> in the main Perl documentation. Only valid sheet names that have been added using the C<add_worksheet()> method can be used in formulas. You cannot reference external workbooks.


The following table lists the operators that are available in Excel's formulas. The majority of the operators are the same as Perl's, differences are indicated:

    Arithmetic operators:
    =====================
    Operator  Meaning                   Example
       +      Addition                  1+2
       -      Subtraction               2-1
       *      Multiplication            2*3
       /      Division                  1/4
       ^      Exponentiation            2^3      # Equivalent to **
       -      Unary minus               -(1+2)
       %      Percent (Not modulus)     13%


    Comparison operators:
    =====================
    Operator  Meaning                   Example
        =     Equal to                  A1 =  B1 # Equivalent to ==
        <>    Not equal to              A1 <> B1 # Equivalent to !=
        >     Greater than              A1 >  B1
        <     Less than                 A1 <  B1
        >=    Greater than or equal to  A1 >= B1
        <=    Less than or equal to     A1 <= B1


    String operator:
    ================
    Operator  Meaning                   Example
        &     Concatenation             "Hello " & "World!" # [1]


    Reference operators:
    ====================
    Operator  Meaning                   Example
        :     Range operator            A1:A4               # [2]
        ,     Union operator            SUM(1, 2+2, B3)     # [3]


    Notes:
    [1]: Equivalent to ("Hello " . "World!") in Perl.
    [2]: This range is equivalent to cells A1, A2, A3 and A4.
    [3]: The comma behaves like the list separator in Perl.

The range and comma operators can have different symbols in non-English versions of Excel. These will be supported in a later version of Excel::XLSX::Writer. European users of Excel take note:

    $worksheet->write('A1', '=SUM(1; 2; 3)'); # Wrong!!
    $worksheet->write('A1', '=SUM(1, 2, 3)'); # Okay

The following table lists all of the core functions supported by Excel 5 and Excel::XLSX::Writer. Any additional functions that are available through the "Analysis ToolPak" or other add-ins are not supported. These functions have all been tested to verify that they work.

If your formula doesn't work in Excel::XLSX::Writer try the following:

    1. Verify that the formula works in Excel (or Gnumeric or OpenOffice.org).
    2. Ensure that it isn't on the Caveats list shown above.
    3. Ensure that cell references and formula names are in uppercase.
    4. Ensure that you are using ':' as the range operator, A1:A4.
    5. Ensure that you are using ',' as the union operator, SUM(1,2,3).




=head1 EXAMPLES




=head2 Example 1

The following example shows some of the basic features of Excel::XLSX::Writer.


    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

    use strict;
    use Excel::XLSX::Writer;

    # Create a new workbook called simple.xls and add a worksheet
    my $workbook  = Excel::XLSX::Writer->new("simple.xls");
    my $worksheet = $workbook->add_worksheet();

    # The general syntax is write($row, $column, $token). Note that row and
    # column are zero indexed

    # Write some text
    $worksheet->write(0, 0,  "Hi Excel!");


    # Write some numbers
    $worksheet->write(2, 0,  3);          # Writes 3
    $worksheet->write(3, 0,  3.00000);    # Writes 3
    $worksheet->write(4, 0,  3.00001);    # Writes 3.00001
    $worksheet->write(5, 0,  3.14159);    # TeX revision no.?


    # Write some formulas
    $worksheet->write(7, 0,  '=A3 + A6');
    $worksheet->write(8, 0,  '=IF(A5>3,"Yes", "No")');


    # Write a hyperlink
    $worksheet->write(10, 0, 'http://www.perl.com/');




=head2 Example 2

The following is a general example which demonstrates some features of working with multiple worksheets.

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

    use strict;
    use Excel::XLSX::Writer;

    # Create a new Excel workbook
    my $workbook = Excel::XLSX::Writer->new("regions.xls");

    # Add some worksheets
    my $north = $workbook->add_worksheet('North');
    my $south = $workbook->add_worksheet('South');
    my $east  = $workbook->add_worksheet('East');
    my $west  = $workbook->add_worksheet('West');

    # Add a Format
    my $format = $workbook->add_format();
    $format->set_bold();
    $format->set_color('blue');

    # Add a caption to each worksheet
    foreach my $worksheet ($workbook->sheets()) {
        $worksheet->write(0, 0, 'Sales', $format);
    }

    # Write some data
    $north->write(0, 1, 200000);
    $south->write(0, 1, 100000);
    $east->write (0, 1, 150000);
    $west->write (0, 1, 100000);

    # Set the active worksheet
    $south->activate();

    # Set the width of the first column
    $south->set_column(0, 0, 20);

    # Set the active cell
    $south->set_selection(0, 1);




=head2 Example 3

This example shows how to use a conditional numerical format with colours to indicate if a share price has gone up or down.

    use strict;
    use Excel::XLSX::Writer;

    # Create a new workbook and add a worksheet
    my $workbook  = Spreadsheet::WriteExcel->new('stocks.xls');
    my $worksheet = $workbook->add_worksheet();

    # Set the column width for columns 1, 2, 3 and 4
    $worksheet->set_column(0, 3, 15);


    # Create a format for the column headings
    my $header = $workbook->add_format();
    $header->set_bold();
    $header->set_size(12);
    $header->set_color('blue');


    # Create a format for the stock price
    my $f_price = $workbook->add_format();
    $f_price->set_align('left');
    $f_price->set_num_format('$0.00');


    # Create a format for the stock volume
    my $f_volume = $workbook->add_format();
    $f_volume->set_align('left');
    $f_volume->set_num_format('#,##0');


    # Create a format for the price change. This is an example of a
    # conditional format. The number is formatted as a percentage. If it is
    # positive it is formatted in green, if it is negative it is formatted
    # in red and if it is zero it is formatted as the default font colour
    # (in this case black). Note: the [Green] format produces an unappealing
    # lime green. Try [Color 10] instead for a dark green.
    #
    my $f_change = $workbook->add_format();
    $f_change->set_align('left');
    $f_change->set_num_format('[Green]0.0%;[Red]-0.0%;0.0%');


    # Write out the data
    $worksheet->write(0, 0, 'Company',$header);
    $worksheet->write(0, 1, 'Price',  $header);
    $worksheet->write(0, 2, 'Volume', $header);
    $worksheet->write(0, 3, 'Change', $header);

    $worksheet->write(1, 0, 'Damage Inc.'       );
    $worksheet->write(1, 1, 30.25,    $f_price ); # $30.25
    $worksheet->write(1, 2, 1234567,  $f_volume); # 1,234,567
    $worksheet->write(1, 3, 0.085,    $f_change); # 8.5% in green

    $worksheet->write(2, 0, 'Dump Corp.'        );
    $worksheet->write(2, 1, 1.56,     $f_price ); # $1.56
    $worksheet->write(2, 2, 7564,     $f_volume); # 7,564
    $worksheet->write(2, 3, -0.015,   $f_change); # -1.5% in red

    $worksheet->write(3, 0, 'Rev Ltd.'          );
    $worksheet->write(3, 1, 0.13,     $f_price ); # $0.13
    $worksheet->write(3, 2, 321,      $f_volume); # 321
    $worksheet->write(3, 3, 0,        $f_change); # 0 in the font color (black)




=head2 Example 4

The following is a simple example of using functions.

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

    use strict;
    use Excel::XLSX::Writer;

    # Create a new workbook and add a worksheet
    my $workbook  = Spreadsheet::WriteExcel->new('stats.xls');
    my $worksheet = $workbook->add_worksheet('Test data');

    # Set the column width for columns 1
    $worksheet->set_column(0, 0, 20);


    # Create a format for the headings
    my $format = $workbook->add_format();
    $format->set_bold();


    # Write the sample data
    $worksheet->write(0, 0, 'Sample', $format);
    $worksheet->write(0, 1, 1);
    $worksheet->write(0, 2, 2);
    $worksheet->write(0, 3, 3);
    $worksheet->write(0, 4, 4);
    $worksheet->write(0, 5, 5);
    $worksheet->write(0, 6, 6);
    $worksheet->write(0, 7, 7);
    $worksheet->write(0, 8, 8);

    $worksheet->write(1, 0, 'Length', $format);
    $worksheet->write(1, 1, 25.4);
    $worksheet->write(1, 2, 25.4);
    $worksheet->write(1, 3, 24.8);
    $worksheet->write(1, 4, 25.0);
    $worksheet->write(1, 5, 25.3);
    $worksheet->write(1, 6, 24.9);
    $worksheet->write(1, 7, 25.2);
    $worksheet->write(1, 8, 24.8);

    # Write some statistical functions
    $worksheet->write(4,  0, 'Count', $format);
    $worksheet->write(4,  1, '=COUNT(B1:I1)');

    $worksheet->write(5,  0, 'Sum', $format);
    $worksheet->write(5,  1, '=SUM(B2:I2)');

    $worksheet->write(6,  0, 'Average', $format);
    $worksheet->write(6,  1, '=AVERAGE(B2:I2)');

    $worksheet->write(7,  0, 'Min', $format);
    $worksheet->write(7,  1, '=MIN(B2:I2)');

    $worksheet->write(8,  0, 'Max', $format);
    $worksheet->write(8,  1, '=MAX(B2:I2)');

    $worksheet->write(9,  0, 'Standard Deviation', $format);
    $worksheet->write(9,  1, '=STDEV(B2:I2)');

    $worksheet->write(10, 0, 'Kurtosis', $format);
    $worksheet->write(10, 1, '=KURT(B2:I2)');



=head2 Example 5

The following example converts a tab separated file called C<tab.txt> into an Excel file called C<tab.xls>.

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

    use strict;
    use Excel::XLSX::Writer;

    open (TABFILE, 'tab.txt') or die "tab.txt: $!";

    my $workbook  = Excel::XLSX::Writer->new('tab.xls');
    my $worksheet = $workbook->add_worksheet();

    # Row and column are zero indexed
    my $row = 0;

    while (<TABFILE>) {
        chomp;
        # Split on single tab
        my @Fld = split('\t', $_);

        my $col = 0;
        foreach my $token (@Fld) {
            $worksheet->write($row, $col, $token);
            $col++;
        }
        $row++;
    }


NOTE: This is a simple conversion program for illustrative purposes only. For converting a CSV or Tab separated or any other type of delimited text file to Excel I recommend the more rigorous csv2xls program that is part of H.Merijn Brand's Text::CSV_XS module distro.

See the examples/csv2xls link here: L<http://search.cpan.org/~hmbrand/Text-CSV_XS/MANIFEST>.

=head1 THE EXCEL XML FORMAT

The Excel XML format is described in the SpreadsheetML specification and XML schemas that are part of the Microsoft Office Schemas. See:

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=FE118952-3547-420A-A412-00A2662442D9&displaylang=en





=head1 WRITING EXCEL FILES

Depending on your requirements, background and general sensibilities you may prefer one of the following methods of getting data into Excel:

=over 4

=item * Spreadsheet::WriteExcel

This module allows creates an Excel in binary format. It uses the same interface as this module but currently has many more features: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel

=item * Win32::OLE module and office automation

This requires a Windows platform and an installed copy of Excel. This is the most powerful and complete method for interfacing with Excel. See L<http://www.activestate.com/ASPN/Reference/Products/ActivePerl-5.6/faq/Windows/ActivePerl-Winfaq12.html> and L<http://www.activestate.com/ASPN/Reference/Products/ActivePerl-5.6/site/lib/Win32/OLE.html>. If your main platform is UNIX but you have the resources to set up a separate Win32/MSOffice server, you can convert office documents to text, postscript or PDF using Win32::OLE. For a demonstration of how to do this using Perl see Docserver: L<http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=docserver>.

=item * CSV, comma separated variables or text

If the file extension is C<csv>, Excel will open and convert this format automatically. Generating a valid CSV file isn't as easy as it seems. Have a look at the DBD::RAM, DBD::CSV, Text::xSV and Text::CSV_XS modules.

=item * DBI with DBD::ADO or DBD::ODBC

Excel files contain an internal index table that allows them to act like a database file. Using one of the standard Perl database modules you can connect to an Excel file as a database.

=item * DBD::Excel

You can also access Spreadsheet::WriteExcel using the standard DBI interface via Takanori Kawai's DBD::Excel module L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-Excel>

=item * Excel::Template

This module allows you to create an Excel file from an XML template in a manner similar to HTML::Template. See L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Excel-Template/>.

=item * Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromXML

This module allows you to turn a simple XML file into an Excel file using Spreadsheet::WriteExcel as a back-end. The format of the XML file is defined by a supplied DTD: L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-FromXML>.

=item * Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::Simple

This provides an easier interface to Spreadsheet::WriteExcel: L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-Simple>.

=item * Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::FromDB

This is a useful module for creating Excel files directly from a DB table: L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-FromDB>.

=item * HTML tables

This is an easy way of adding formatting via a text based format.

=item * XML or HTML

The Excel XML and HTML file specification are available from L<http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/officedev/ofxml2k/ofxml2k.htm>.

=back

For other Perl-Excel modules try the following search: L<http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=excel>.




=head1 READING EXCEL FILES

To read data from Excel files try:

=over 4

=item * Spreadsheet::ParseExcel

John McNamara jmcnamara@cpan.org

    Should poets bicycle-pump the human heart
        Or squash it flat?
    Man's love is of man's life a thing apart;
        Girls aren't like that.

    We men have got love well weighed up; our stuff
        Can get by without it.
    Women don't seem to think that's good enough;
        They write about it,

        -- Kingsley Amis
