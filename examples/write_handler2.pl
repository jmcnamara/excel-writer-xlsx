# Example of how to add a user defined data handler to the

#
# The following example shows how to add a handler for a 7 digit ID number.
# It adds an additional constraint to the write_handler1.pl in that it only
# filters data that isn't in the third column.

# Add a handler for 7 digit id numbers. This is useful when you want a string
# such as 0000001 written as a string instead of a number and thus preserve
# the leading zeroes.
#
# Note: you can get the same effect using the keep_leading_zeros() method but
# this serves as a simple example.

# The following function processes the data when a match is found. The handler
# is set up so that it only filters data if it is in the third column.
