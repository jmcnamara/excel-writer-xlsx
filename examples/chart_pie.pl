# A demo of a Pie chart in Excel::Writer::XLSX.
#
# The demo also shows how to set segment colours. It is possible to define
# chart colors for most types of Excel::Writer::XLSX charts via the
# add_series() method. However, Pie and Doughtnut charts are a special case
# since each segment is represented as a point so it is necessary to assign
# formatting to each point in the series.
