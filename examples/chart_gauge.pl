# A demo of an Gauge Chart in Excel::Writer::XLSX.
#
# A Gauge Chart isn't a native chart type in Excel. It is constructed by
# combining a doughnut chart and a pie chart and by using some non-filled
# elements. This example follows the following online example of how to create
# a Gauge Chart in Excel: https://www.excel-easy.com/examples/gauge-chart.html
