Revision history for Perl module Excel::Writer::XLSX.

     + New feature/improvement.
     - Removed/deprecated feature.
     ! Bug fix.

1.07 2020-08-06

   + Added support for Border, Fill, Pattern and Gradient formatting to chart
     data labels and chart custom data labels.


1.06 2020-08-03

   ! Fix for issue where array formulas weren't included in the output file
     for certain ranges/conditions.


1.05 2020-07-30

   + Added support for custom data labels in charts.


1.04 2020-05-31

   + Added support for "stacked" and "percent_stacked" Line charts.

   ! Fix for worksheet objects (charts and images) that are inserted with an
     offset that starts in a hidden cell.

   ! Fix for issue with default worksheet VBA codenames.

   - Removed error in add_worksheet() for sheet name "History" which is a
     reserved name in English version of Excel. However, this is an allowed
     worksheet name in some Excel variants so the warning has been turned into
     a documentation note instead.

1.03 2019-12-26

   + Fix for duplicate images being copied to an Excel::Writer::XLSX
     file. Excel uses an optimization where it only stores one copy of a
     repeated/duplicate image in a workbook. Excel::Writer::XLSX didn't do
     this which meant that the file size would increase when then was a large
     number of repeated images. This release fixes that issue and replicates
     Excel's behaviour.


1.02 2019-11-07

   + Added support for hyperlinks in worksheet images.

   + Increased allowable url length from 255 to 2079 characters, as allowed in
     more recent versions of Excel.


1.01 2019-10-28

   + Added support for stacked and  East Asian vertical chart fonts.

   + Added option to control positioning of charts or images when cells are
     resized.

   + Added support for combining Pie/Doughnut charts.

   ! Fixed sizing of cell comment boxes when they cross columns/rows that have
     size changes that occur after the comment is written. Comments should
     now behave like other worksheet objects such as images and charts.

   ! Fix for structured reference in chart ranges.


1.00 2019-04-07

   !  Fixed issue where images that started in hidden rows/columns weren't placed
      correctly in the worksheet.

   !  Fixed the mime-type reported by system "file(1)". The mime-type reported
      by "file --mime-type"/magic was incorrect for Excel::Writer::XLSX files
      since it expected the "[Content_types]" to be the first file in the zip
      container.


0.99 2019-02-10

   + Added font and font_size parameters to write_comment().

   + Allow formulas in date field of data_validation().

   + Added set_tab_ratio() method to set the ratio between the worksheet tabs
     and the horizontal slider.

     and column headings.

   ! Fix for issue with special characters in worksheet table functions.

   ! Fix handling of 'num_format': '0' in duplicate formats.


0.98 2018-04-14

   + Set the xlsx internal file member datetimes to 1980-01-01 00:00:00 like
     Excel so that apps can produce a consistent binary file once the
     workbook set_properties() created date is set. Feature request #168.


0.97 2018-04-10

   + Added Excel 2010 data bar features such as solid fills and control over
     the display of negative values.

   + Added default formatting for hyperlinks if none is specified. The format
     is the Excel hyperlink style so links change colour after they are
     clicked.

      This fixes an issue where the memory used for the worksheet
      data tables was freed but then brought back into usage due

      meant that the memory usage still continued to grow with
      large row counts.

     ! Fix for issue #16. Format::copy() method not protecting values.
       The Format copy() method over-writes certain new properties that
       weren't in Spreadsheet::WriteExcel. This fixes the issue by
       storing and restoring the properties during copy.

     ! Fix for issue #15: write_url with local sub directory.
       Local sub-directories were incorrectly treated as
       file:// external.

       are now converted to zero in chart data cache, as required

      Krishna Rajendran.
