0.51 2012-16-09

    + Speed optimisations.

      This release contains a series of optimisations aimed
      at increasing the speed of Excel::Writer::XLSX. The
      overall improvement is around 66%.
      See the SPEED AND MEMORY USAGE section of the documentation.

    + Memory usage optimisations.

      This fixes an issue where the memory used for the worksheet
      data tables was freed but then brought back into usage due
      to the use of an array as the base data structure. This
      meant that the memory usage still continued to grow with
      large row counts.


    ! Added warning about Excel limit to 65,530 urls per worksheet.

    ! Limit URLs to Excel's limit of 255 chars. Fixes Issue #26.

    ! Fix for whitespace in urls. Fixes Issue #25.

    ! Fix for solid fill of type 'none' is chart series.
      Closes issue #27 reported on Stack Overflow.

    ! Modified write_array_formula() to apply format over full range.
      Fixes issue #18.

    ! Fix for issue with chart formula referring to non-existent sheet name.
      It is now a fatal error to specify a chart series formula that
      refers to an non-existent worksheet name. Fixes issue #17.


0.50 2012-09-09

     + Added option to add secondary axes to charts.
       Thanks to Eric Johnson and to Foxtons for sponsoring the work.

     ! Fix for right/left auto shape connection when destination
       is left of source shape. Thanks to Dave Clarke for fix.

     ! Fix for issue #16. Format::copy() method not protecting values.
       The Format copy() method over-writes certain new properties that
       weren't in Spreadsheet::WriteExcel. This fixes the issue by
       storing and restoring the properties during copy.

     ! Fix for issue #15: write_url with local sub directory.
       Local sub-directories were incorrectly treated as
       file:// external.

     ! Fix for for issue #14: Non-numeric data in chart value axes
       are now converted to zero in chart data cache, as required
       by Excel.

      blank data.

      Krishna Rajendran.
